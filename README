About DynamoRIO

DynamoRIO is a runtime code manipulation system that supports code
transformations on any part of a program, while it executes. DynamoRIO
exports an interface for building dynamic tools for a wide variety of uses:
program analysis and understanding, profiling, instrumentation,
optimization, translation, etc. Unlike many dynamic tool systems, DynamoRIO
is not limited to insertion of callouts/trampolines and allows arbitrary
modifications to application instructions via a powerful IA-32/AMD64/ARM/AArch64
instruction manipulation library. DynamoRIO provides efficient,
transparent, and comprehensive manipulation of unmodified applications
running on stock operating systems (Windows, Linux, or Android) and commodity
IA-32, AMD64, ARM, and AArch64 hardware.

Quickstart instructions for running DynamoRIO:

--------------------------------------------------
On Linux:

To run the application with a DynamoRIO sample client:
32-bit:
  % bin32/drrun -c samples/bin32/libbbsize.so -- ls
64-bit:
  % bin64/drrun -c samples/bin64/libbbsize.so -- ls

To run the application with a DynamoRIO-based tool:
32-bit:
  % bin32/drrun -t drcachesim -- ls
64-bit
  % bin64/drrun -t drcachesim -- ls

To run the Dr. Memory tool which is included in release packages:
  % bin32/drrun -t drmemory -- <my-32-bit-app> <args-to-app>

For additional options and to list available tools for -t:
  % bin32/drrun -help

For full control over child processes use a two-step process:
first configure with bin32/drconfig and then invoke the parent
process with bin32/drinject.

--------------------------------------------------
On Windows, with examples run from a cygwin shell (for cmd shell replace
the first slash with a backward slash: e.g., bin32\drrun.exe):

Method 1: directly invoke an application:
To run the application with a DynamoRIO sample client:
32-bit
  % bin32/drrun.exe -c samples/bin32/bbsize.dll -- notepad
64-bit
  % bin64/drrun.exe -c samples/bin64/bbsize.dll -- notepad

To run the application with a DynamoRIO-based tool:
32-bit
  % bin32/drrun.exe -t drstrace -- notepad
64-bit
  % bin64/drrun.exe -t drstrace -- notepad

To run the Dr. Memory tool which is included in release packages:
  % bin32/drrun.exe -t drmemory -- <my-32-bit-app> <args-to-app>

For additional options and to list available tools for -t:
  % bin32/drrun.exe -help

Method 2: configure an application and launch it separately.
This requires administrative privileges:
32-bit:
  % bin32/drconfig.exe -reg notepad.exe -syswide_on -c samples/bin32/bbsize.dll
64-bit:
  % bin64/drconfig.exe -reg notepad.exe -syswide_on -c samples/bin64/bbsize.dll
Now run the application however you normally would, with the mouse or from
the command line.  From a cygwin shell this will run 32-bit notepad:
  % cmd /c start notepad

Now close notepad and a messagebox should pop up produced by the bbsize client.

Note that if you use cygwin unzip to extract files from the release package
.zip file, you'll need to mark all the .dll and .exe files as ugo+rx in
order to execute them.
