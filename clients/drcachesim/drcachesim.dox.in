\page page_drcachesim Cache Simulator

\p drcachesim is a DynamoRIO client that collects memory access traces and
feeds them to either an online or offline tool for analysis.  The default
analysis tool is a CPU cache simulator, while other provided tools compute
metrics such as reuse distance.  The trace collector and simulator support
multiple processes each with multiple threads.  The analysis tool framework
is extensible, supporting the creation of new tools which can operate both
online and offline.

\section sec_drcachesim Overview

\p drcachesim consists of two components: a tracer and an analyzer.
The tracer collects a memory access trace from each thread within each
application process.
The analyzer consumes the traces (online or offline) and performs
customized analysis.
It is designed to be extensible, allowing users to easily implement a
simulator for different devices, such as CPU caches, TLBs, page
caches, etc. (see \ref sec_drcachesim_extend), or to build arbitrary trace
analysis tools (see \ref sec_drcachesim_newtool).
The default analyzer simulates the architectural behavior of caching
devices for a target application (or multiple applications).

****************************************************************************
\section sec_drcachesim_run Running the Simulator

To launch \p drcachesim, use the \p -t flag to \p drrun:

\code
$ bin64/drrun -t drcachesim -- /path/to/target/app <args> <for> <app>
\endcode

The target application will be launched under a DynamoRIO tracer
client that gathers all of its memory references and passes them to
the simulator via a pipe.  (See \ref sec_drcachesim_offline for how to dump
a trace for offline analysis.)
Any child processes will be followed into and profiled, with their
memory references passed to the simulator as well.

Here is an example:

\code
$ bin64/drrun -t drcachesim -- ~/test/pi_estimator

\section sec_drcachesim_tools Analysis Tool Suite

In addition to a CPU cache simulator, other analysis tools are available
that operate on memory address traces.  Which tool is used can be selected
with the \p -simulator_type parameter.

To simulate TLB devices instead of caches, pass \p TLB to \p -simulator_type:

\code
$ bin64/drrun -t drcachesim -simulator_type TLB -- ~/test/pi_estimator

The non-fetched instructions are x86 string loop instructions, where
subsequent iterations do not incur a fetch.  They are included in the trace
as a different type of trace entry to support core simulators in addition
to cache simulators.

The opcode_mix tool uses the non-fetched instruction information along with
the preserved libraries and binaries from the traced execution to gather
more information on each executed instruction than was stored in the trace.
It only supports offline traces, and the \p modules.log file created during
post-processing of the trace must be preserved.  The results are broken
down by the opcodes used in DR's IR, where \p mov is split into a separate
opcode for load and store but both have the same public string "mov":

\code
$ bin64/drrun -t drcachesim -offline -- ~/test/pi_estimator

The view tool prints out disassembled instructions in att, intel, arm or DR
format for offline traces. The -skip_refs and -sim_refs flags can be used to
set a start point and end point for the disassembled view. Note that these
flags compute the number of instructions which are skipped or displayed which
is distinct from the number of trace entries.

\section sec_drcachesim_config_file Configuration File

\p drcachesim supports reconfigurable cache hierarchies defined in
a configuration file. The configuration file is a text file with the following
formatting rules.

- A comment starts with two slashes followed by one or more spaces. Anything
after the '// ' until the end of the line is considered a comment and ignored.
- A parameter's name and its value are listed consecutively with white space
(spaces, tabs, or a new line) between them.
- Parameters must be separated by white space. Including one parameter per line
helps keep the configuration file more human-readable.
- A cache's parameters must be enclosed inside braces and preceded by the
cache's user-chosen unique name.
- Parameters can be listed in any order.
- Parameters not included in the configuration file take their default values.
- String values must not be enclosed in quotations.

Supported common parameters and their value types (each of these parameters
sets the corresponding option with the same name described in \ref sec_drcachesim_ops):
- num_cores \<unsigned int\>
- line_size \<unsigned int\>
- skip_refs \<unsigned int\>
- warmup_refs \<unsigned int\>
- warmup_fraction \<float in [0,1]\>
- sim_refs \<unsigned int\>
- cpu_scheduling \<bool\>
- verbose \<unsigned int\>

Supported cache parameters and their value types:
- type \<string, one of "instruction", "data", or "unified"\>
- core \<unsigned int in [0, num_cores)\>
- size \<unsigned int, power of 2\>
- assoc \<unsigned int, power of 2\>
- inclusive \<bool\>
- parent \<string\>
- replace_policy \<string, one of "LRU", "LFU", or "FIFO"\>
- prefetcher \<string, one of "nextline" or "none"\>
- miss_file \<string\>

Example:
\code
// Configuration for a single-core CPU.

// Common params.
num_cores       1
line_size       64
cpu_scheduling  true
sim_refs        8888888
warmup_fraction 0.8

// Cache params.
P0L1I {                        // P0 L1 instruction cache

****************************************************************************
\section sec_drcachesim_offline Offline Traces and Analysis

To dump a trace for future offline analysis, use the \p offline parameter:
\code
$ bin64/drrun -t drcachesim -offline -- /path/to/target/app <args> <for> <app>
\endcode

The collected traces will be dumped into a newly created directory,
which can be passed to drcachesim for offline cache simulation with the \p
-indir option:
\code
$ bin64/drrun -t drcachesim -indir drmemtrace.app.pid.xxxx.dir/
\endcode

The direct results of the \p -offline run are raw, compacted files, stored
in a \p raw/ subdirectory of the \p drmemtrace.app.pid.xxxx.dir directory.
The \p -indir option both converts the data to a canonical trace form and
passes the resulting data to the cache simulator.  The canonical trace data
is stored by \p -indir in a \p trace/ subdirectory inside the \p
drmemtrace.app.pid.xxxx.dir/ directory.  For both the raw and canonical
data, a separate file per application thread is used.  If the canonical
data already exists, future runs will use that data rather than
re-converting it.  Either the top-level directory or the \p trace/
subdirectory may be pointed at with \p -indir:

\code
$ bin64/drrun -t drcachesim -indir drmemtrace.app.pid.xxxx.dir/trace
\endcode

The canonical trace files may be manually compressed with gzip, as the
trace reader supports reading gzipped files.

Older versions of the simulator produced a single trace file containing all threads
interleaved.  The \p -infile option supports reading these legacy files:
\code
$ gzip drmemtrace.app.pid.xxxx.dir/drmemtrace.trace
$ bin64/drrun -t drcachesim -infile drmemtrace.app.pid.xxxx.dir/drmemtrace.trace.gz
\endcode

The same analysis tools used online are available for offline: the trace
format is identical.

****************************************************************************
\section sec_drcachesim_partial Tracing a Subset of Execution

While the cache simulator supports skipping references, for large
applications the overhead of the tracing itself is too high to conveniently
trace the entire execution.  There are several methods of tracing only
during a desired window of execution.

The \p -trace_after_instrs option delays tracing by the specified number of
dynamic instruction executions.  This can be used to skip initialization
and arrive at the desired starting point.  The trace's length can also be
limited by the \p -exit_after_tracing option.

If the application can be modified, it can be linked with the \p drcachesim
tracer and use DynamoRIO's start/stop API routines dr_app_setup_and_start()
and dr_app_stop_and_cleanup() to delimit the desired trace region.  As an
example, see <a
href="https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio/blob/master/clients/drcachesim/tests/burst_static.cpp">our
burst_static test application</a>.

****************************************************************************
\section sec_drcachesim_sim Simulator Details

Generally, the simulator is able to be extended to model a variety of
caching devices.  Currently, CPU caches and TLBs are implemented.  The type of
device to simulate can be specified by the parameter
"-simulator_type" (see \ref sec_drcachesim_ops).

The CPU cache simulator models a configurable number of cores,
each with an L1 data cache and an L1 instruction cache.
Currently there is a single shared L2 unified cache, but we would like to
extend support to arbitrary cache hierarchies (see \ref sec_drcachesim_limit).
The cache line size and each cache's total size and associativity are
user-specified (see \ref sec_drcachesim_ops).

The TLB simulator models a configurable number of cores, each with an
L1 instruction TLB, an L1 data TLB, and an L2 unified TLB.  Each TLB's
entry number and associativity, and the virtual/physical page size,
are user-specified (see \ref sec_drcachesim_ops).

Neither simulator has a simple way to know which core any particular thread
executed on for each of its instructions.  The tracer records which core a
thread is on each time it writes out a full trace buffer, giving an
approximation of the actual scheduling (at the granularity of the trace
buffer size).  By default, these cache and TLB simulators ignore that
information and schedule threads to simulated cores in a static round-robin
fashion with load balancing to fill in gaps with new threads after threads
exit.  The option "-cpu_scheduling" (see \ref sec_drcachesim_ops) can be
used to instead map each physical cpu to a simulated core and use the
recorded cpu that each segment of thread execution occurred on to schedule
execution in a manner that more closely resembles the traced execution on
the physical machine.  Below is an example of the output using this option
running an application with many threads on a pysical machine with 8 cpus.
The 8 cpus are mapped to the 4 simulated cores:

The memory access traces contain some optimizations that combine references
for one basic block together.  This may result in not considering some
thread interleavings that could occur natively.  There are no other
disruptions to thread ordering, however, and the application runs with all
of its threads concurrently just like it would natively (although slower).

Once every process has exited, the simulator prints cache miss statistics
for each cache to stderr.  The simulator is designed to be extensible,
allowing for different cache studies to be carried out: see \ref
sec_drcachesim_extend.

For L2 caching devices, the L1 caching devices are considered its _children_.
Two separate miss rates are computed, one (the "Local miss rate") considering
just requests that reach L2 while the other (the "Total miss rate")
includes the child hits.

For memory requests that cross blocks, each block touched is
considered separately, resulting in separate hit and miss statistics.  This
can be changed by implementing a custom statistics gatherer (see \ref
sec_drcachesim_extend).

Software and hardware prefetches are combined in the prefetch hit and miss
statistics, which are reported separately from regular loads and stores.
To isolate software prefetch statistics, disable the hardware prefetcher by
running with "-data_prefetcher none" (see \ref sec_drcachesim_ops).
While misses from software prefetches are included in cache miss files,
misses from hardware prefetches are not.


****************************************************************************
\section sec_drcachesim_analyzer Cache Miss Analyzer

The cache simulator can be used to analyze the stream of last-level cache (LLC)
miss addresses. This can be useful when looking for patterns that can be utilized
in software prefetching. The current analyzer can only identify simple stride
patterns, but it can be extended to search for more complex patterns.
To invoke the miss analyzer, pass \p miss_analyzer to the \p -simulator_type
parameter. To write the prefetching hints to a file use the \p -LL_miss_file
parameter to specify the file's path and name.

For example, to run the analyzer on a benchmark called "my_benchmark" and store
the prefetching recommendations in a file called "rec.csv", run the following:

\code
$ bin64/drrun -t drcachesim -simulator_type miss_analyzer -LL_miss_file rec.csv -- my_benchmark
\endcode


****************************************************************************
\section sec_drcachesim_phys Physical Addresses

The memory access tracing client gathers virtual addresses.  On Linux, if
the kernel allows user-mode applications access to the \p
/proc/self/pagemap file, physical addresses may be used instead.  This can
be requested via the \p -use_physical runtime option (see \ref
sec_drcachesim_ops).  This works on current kernels but is expected to stop
working from user mode on future kernels due to recent security changes
(see
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=ab676b7d6fbf4b294bf198fb27ade5b0e865c7ce).

****************************************************************************
\section sec_drcachesim_core Core Simulation Support

The \p drcachesim trace format includes information intended for use by
core simulators as well as pure cache simulators.  For traces that are not
filtered by an online first-level cache, each data reference is preceded by
the instruction fetch entry for the instruction that issued the data
request.  Additionally, on x86, string loop
instructions involve a single insruction fetch followed by a loop of loads
and/or stores.  A \p drcachesim trace includes a special "no-fetch"
instruction entry per iteration so that core simulators have the
instruction information to go along with each load and store, while cache
simulators can ignore these "no-fetch" entries and avoid incorrectly
inflating instruction fetch statistics.

Offline traces guarantee that a branch target instruction entry in a
trace must immediately follow the branch instruction with no intervening
thread switch.  This allows a core simulator to identify the target of a
branch by looking at the subsequent trace entry.

Traces include scheduling markers providing the timestamp and hardware
thread identifier on each thread transition, allowing a simulator to more
closely match the actual hardware if so desired.

Traces also include markers indicating disruptions in user mode control
flow such as signal handler entry and exit.

A final feature that aids core simulators is the pair of interfaces
module_mapper_t::get_loaded_modules() and
module_mapper_t::find_mapped_trace_address(), which facilitate reading the raw
bytes for each instruction in order to obtain the opcode and full operand
information.

****************************************************************************
\section sec_drcachesim_extend Extending the Simulator

The \p drcachesim tool was designed to be extensible, allowing users to
easily model different caching devices, implement different models, and
gather custom statistics.

To model different caching devices, subclass the \p simulator_t,
caching_device_t, caching_device_block_t, caching_device_stats_t classes.

To implement a different cache model, subclass the \p cache_t class and
override the \p request(), \p access_update(), and/or \p
replace_which_way() method(s).

Statistics gathering is separated out into the \p caching_device_stats_t
class.  To implement custom statistics, subclass \p caching_device_stats_t
and override the \p access(), \p child_access(), \p flush(), and/or
\p print_stats() methods.

****************************************************************************
\section sec_drcachesim_tracer Customizing the Tracer

The tracer supports customization for special-purpose i/o via
drmemtrace_replace_file_ops(), allowing traces to be written to locations
not supported by simple UNIX file operations.  One option for using this
function is to create a new client which links with the provided
drmemtrace_static library, includes the \p drmemtrace/drmemtrace.h header via:

\code
use_DynamoRIO_drmemtrace_tracer(mytool)
\endcode

And includes its own dr_client_main() which calls
drmemtrace_client_main().

The tracer also supports storing custom data with each module (i.e.,
library or executable) such as a build identifier via
drmemtrace_custom_module_data().  The custom data may be retrieved by
creating a custom offline trace post-processor and using the #module_mapper_t
class.

\p drcachesim provides a \p drmemtrace analysis tool framework to make it
easy to create new trace analysis tools.  A new tool should subclass
#analysis_tool_t.

Concurrent processing of traces is supported by logically splitting a trace into
"shards" which are each processed sequentially.  The default shard is a traced
application thread, but the tool interface can support other divisions.  For tools
that support concurrent processing of shards and do not need to see a single
time-sorted interleaved merged trace, the interface functions with the parallel_
prefix should be overridden, and parallel_shard_supported() should return true.
parallel_shard_init() will be invoked for each shard prior to invoking
parallel_shard_memref() for each entry in that shard; the data structure returned
from parallel_shard_init() will be passed to parallel_shard_memref() for each
trace entry for that shard.  The concurrency model used guarantees that all
entries from any one shard are processed by the same single worker thread, so no
synchronization is needed inside the parallel_ functions.  A single worker thread
invokes print_results() as well.

For serial operation, process_memref(), operates on a trace entry in a single,
sorted, interleaved stream of trace entries.  In the default mode of operation,
the #analyzer_t class iterates over the trace and calls the process_memref()
function of each tool.  An alternative mode is supported which exposes the
iterator and allows a separate control infrastructure to be built.  This
alternative mode does not support parallel operation at this time.

Both parallel and serial operation can be supported by a tool, typically by having
process_memref() create data on a newly seen traced thread and invoking
parallel_shard_memref() to do its work.

For both parallel and serial operation, the function print_results() should be
overridden.  It is called just once after processing all trace data and it should
present the results of the analysis.  For parallel operation, any desired
aggregation across the whole trace should occur here as well, while shard-specific
results can be presented in parallel_shard_exit().

Today, parallel analysis is only supported for offline traces.
Support for online traces may be added in the future.

In the default mode of operation, the #analyzer_t class iterates over
the trace and calls the appropriate #analysis_tool_t functions for
each tool.  An alternative mode is supported which exposes the
iterator and allows a separate control infrastructure to be built.

Each trace entry is of type #memref_t and represents one instruction or
data reference or a metadata operation such as a thread exit or marker.
There are built-in scheduling markers providing the timestamp and cpu
identifier on each thread transition.  Other built-in markers indicate
disruptions in user mode control flow such as signal handler entry and
exit.

CMake support is provided for including the headers and linking the
libraries of the \p drmemtrace framework.  A new CMake function is defined
in the DynamoRIO package which sets the include directory for using the \p
drmemtrace/ headers:

\code
use_DynamoRIO_drmemtrace(mytool)
\endcode

The \p drmemtrace_analyzer library exported by the DynamoRIO package is the
main library to link when building a new tool.  The tools described above
are also exported as the libraries \p drmemtrace_basic_counts, \p drmemtrace_view,
\p drmemtrace_opcode_mix, \p drmemtrace_histogram, \p drmemtrace_reuse_distance, \p
drmemtrace_reuse_time, and \p drmemtrace_simulator and can be created using
the basic_counts_tool_create(), opcode_mix_tool_create(), histogram_tool_create(),
reuse_distance_tool_create(), reuse_time_tool_create(), view_tool_create(),
cache_simulator_create(), and tlb_simulator_create() functions.

\section sec_drcachesim_ops Simulator Parameters

\p drcachesim's behavior can be controlled through options passed after the
\p -c \p drcachesim but prior to the "--" delimiter on the command line:

\code
$ bin64/drrun -t drcachesim <options> <to> <drcachesim> -- /path/to/target/app <args> <for> <app>
\endcode

Boolean options can be disabled using a "-no_" prefix.

The parameters available are described below:

REPLACEME_WITH_OPTION_LIST

\section sec_drcachesim_limit Current Limitations

The \p drcachesim tool is a work in progress.  We welcome contributions in
these areas of missing functionality:

- Cache coherence (https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio/issues/1726)
- Multi-process online application simulation on Windows
  (https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio/issues/1727)
- Arbitrary cache hierarchy support via an input config file
  (https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio/issues/1715)
- Offline traces do not currently accurately record instruction fetches in
  dynamically generated code (https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio/issues/2062).
  All data references are included, but instruction fetches may be skipped.
  This problem is limited to offline traces.
- Application phase marking is not yet implemented
  (https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio/issues/2478).

\section sec_drcachesim_cmp Comparison to Other Simulators

\p drcachesim is one of the few simulators to support multiple processes.
This feature requires an out-of-process simulator and inter-process
communication.  A single-process design would incur less overhead.  Thus,
we expect \p drcachesim to pay for its multi-process support with
potentially unfavorable performance versus single-process simulators.

When comparing cache hits, misses, and miss rates across simulators, the
details can vary substantially.  For example, some other simulators (such
as \p cachegrind) do not split memory references that cross cache lines
into multiple hits or misses, while \p drcachesim does split them.
Instructions that reference multiple memory words on the same cache line
(such as \p ldm on ARM) are considered to be single accesses by \p
drcachesim, while other simulators (such as \p cachegrind) may split the
accesses into separate pieces.  A final example involves string loop
instructions on x86.  \p drcachesim considers only the first iteration to
involve an instruction fetch (presenting subsequent iterations as a
"non-fetched instruction" which the simulator ignores: the basic_counts
tool does show these as a separate statistics), while other simulators
(incorrectly) issue a fetch to the instruction cache on every iteration of
the string loop.
