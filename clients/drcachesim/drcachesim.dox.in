\page page_drcachesim Cache Simulator

\p drcachesim is a DynamoRIO client that collects memory access traces
and feeds them to an online or offline tool for analysis.
The default analysis tool is a cache simulator which simulates a set of
specific caching devices, e.g., CPU caches and TLBs.  The trace collector and
simulator support multiple processes each with multiple threads.

\section sec_drcachesim Overview

\p drcachesim consists of two components: a tracer and an analyzer.
The tracer collects a memory access trace from each thread within each
application process.
The analyzer consumes the traces (online or offline) and performs
customized analysis.
It is designed to be extensible, allowing users to easily implement a
simulator for different devices, such as CPU caches, TLBs, page
caches, etc. (see \ref sec_drcachesim_extend).
The default analyzer simulates the architectural behavior of caching
devices for a target application (or multiple applications).

\section sec_drcachesim_run Running the Simulator

To launch \p drcachesim, use the \p -t flag to \p drrun:

\code
bin64/drrun -t drcachesim -- /path/to/target/app <args> <for> <app>
\endcode

The target application will be launched under a DynamoRIO tracer
client that gathers all of its memory references and passes them to
the simulator via a pipe.
Any child processes will be followed into and profiled, with their
memory references passed to the simulator as well.

To simulate TLB devices instead of caches, use the \p -simulator_type
parameter:

\code
bin64/drrun -t drcachesim -simulator_type TLB -- /path/to/target/app <args> <for> <app>
\endcode

Several other trace analysis tools are under development.

To dump the trace for future offline analysis:
\code
bin64/drrun -t drcachesim -offline -- /path/to/target/app <args> <for> <app>
\endcode

The collected traces will be dumped into a newly created directory,
which can be passed to drcachesim for offline cache simulation with the \p
-indir option:
\code
bin64/drrun -t drcachesim -indir drmemtrace.app.pid.xxxx.dir/
\endcode

The direct results of the \p -offline run are raw, compacted files, stored
in a \p raw subdirectory of the \p drmemtrace.app.pid.xxxx.dir directory.
The \p -indir option both converts the data to a canonical trace form and
passes the resulting data to the cache simulator.  The canonical trace data
is stored by \p -indir in a file named \p drmemtrace.trace inside the \p
drmemtrace.app.pid.xxxx.dir/ directory.  Future runs can point directly at
this file using the \p -infile option:
\code
bin64/drrun -t drcachesim -infile drmemtrace.app.pid.xxxx.dir/drmemtrace.trace
\endcode

The \p -infile option supports reading a gzipped trace file, allowing
compression of the \p drmemtrace.trace file to save space:
\code
gzip drmemtrace.app.pid.xxxx.dir/drmemtrace.trace
bin64/drrun -t drcachesim -infile drmemtrace.app.pid.xxxx.dir/drmemtrace.trace.gz
\endcode

\section sec_drcachesim_sim Simulator Details

Generally, the simulator is able to be extended to model a variety of
caching devices.  Currently, CPU caches and TLBs are implemented.  The type of
device to simulate can be specified by the parameter
"-simulator_type" (see \ref sec_drcachesim_ops).

The CPU cache simulator models a configurable number of cores,
each with an L1 data cache and an L1 instruction cache.
Currently there is a single shared L2 unified cache, but we would like to
extend support to arbitrary cache hierarchies (see \ref sec_drcachesim_limit).
The cache line size and each cache's total size and associativity are
user-specified (see \ref sec_drcachesim_ops).

The TLB simulator models a configurable number of cores, each with an
L1 instruction TLB, an L1 data TLB, and an L2 unified TLB.  Each TLB's
entry number and associativity, and the virtual/physical page size,
are user-specified (see \ref sec_drcachesim_ops).

Neither simulator has a simple way to know which core any particular thread
executed on at a given point in time.  Instead it uses a simple static
scheduling of threads to cores, using a round-robin assignment with load
balancing to fill in gaps with new threads after threads exit.

The memory access traces contain some optimizations that combine references
for one basic block together.  This may result in not considering some
thread interleavings that could occur natively.  There are no other
disruptions to thread ordering, however, and the application runs with all
of threads concurrently just like it would natively (although slower).

Once every process has exited, the simulator prints cache miss statistics
for each cache to stderr.  The simulator is designed to be extensible,
allowing for different cache studies to be carried out: see \ref
sec_drcachesim_extend.

For L2 caching devices, the L1 caching devices are considered its _children_.
Two separate miss rates are computed, one (the "Local miss rate") considering
just requests that reach L2 while the other (the "Total miss rate")
includes the child hits.

For memory requests that cross blocks, each block touched is
considered separately, resulting in separate hit and miss statistics.  This
can be changed by implementing a custom statistics gatherer (see \ref
sec_drcachesim_extend).


\section sec_drcachesim_phys Physical Addresses

The memory access tracing client gathers virtual addresses.  On Linux, if
the kernel allows user-mode applications access to the \p
/proc/self/pagemap file, physical addresses may be used instead.  This can
be requested via the \p -use_physical runtime option (see \ref
sec_drcachesim_ops).  This works on current kernels but is expected to stop
working from user mode on future kernels due to recent security changes
(see
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=ab676b7d6fbf4b294bf198fb27ade5b0e865c7ce).


\section sec_drcachesim_limit Current Limitations

The \p drcachesim tool is a work in progress.  We welcome contributions in
these areas of missing functionality:

- Cache coherence (https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio/issues/1726)
- Multi-process online application simulation on Windows (https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio/issues/1727)
- Arbitrary cache hierarchy support via an input config file
  (https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio/issues/1715)


\section sec_drcachesim_extend Extending the Simulator

The \p drcachesim tool was designed to be extensible, allowing users to
easily model different caching devices, implement different models, and
gather custom statistics.

To model different caching devices, subclass the \p simulator_t,
caching_device_t, caching_device_block_t, caching_device_stats_t classes.

To implement a different cache model, subclass the \p cache_t class and
override the \p request(), \p access_update(), and/or \p
replace_which_way() method(s).

Statistics gathering is separated out into the \p caching_device_stats_t
class.  To implement custom statistics, subclass \p caching_device_stats_t
and override the \p access(), \p child_access(), \p flush(), and/or
\p print_stats() methods.


\section sec_drcachesim_ops Simulator Parameters

\p drcachesim's behavior can be controlled through options passed after the
\p -c \p drcachesim but prior to the "--" delimiter on the command line:

\code
bin64/drrun -t drcachesim <options> <to> <drcachesim> -- /path/to/target/app <args> <for> <app>
\endcode

Boolean options can be disabled using a "-no_" prefix.

The parameters available are described below:

REPLACEME_WITH_OPTION_LIST


\section sec_drcachesim_cmp Comparison to Other Simulators

\p drcachesim is one of the few simulators to support multiple processes.
This feature requires an out-of-process simulator and inter-process
communication.  A single-process design would incur less overhead.  Thus,
we expect \p drcachesim to pay for its multi-process support with
potentially unfavorable performance versus single-process simulators.

When comparing cache hits, misses, and miss rates across simulators, the
details can vary substantially.  For example, some other simulators (such
as \p cachegrind) do not split memory references that cross cache lines
into multiple hits or misses.  Additionally, instructions that reference
multiple memory words (such as \p ldm on ARM) are considered to be single
accesses by \p drcachesim, while other simulators (such as \p cachegrind)
may split the accesses into separate pieces.
