/**

 * @brief DrMemtrace record filter trace analysis tool creation.
 */

/**
 * Creates a record analysis tool that filters the #trace_entry_t records of an offline
 * trace. Streams through each shard independenty and parallelly, and writes the
 * filtered version to the output directory with the same base name. Serial mode is not
 * yet supported. The options specify the filter(s) to employ.
 *
 * @param[in] output_dir  The destination directory for the new filtered trace.
 * @param[in] stop_timestamp  Disables filtering (outputs everything) once a timestamp
 *   equal to or greater than this value is seen.
 * @param[in] cache_filter_size  Enables a data cache filter with the given size in
 *   bytes with 64-byte lines and a direct mapped LRU cache.
 * @param[in] remove_trace_types  A comma-separated list of integers of #trace_type_t
 *   types to remove.
 * @param[in] remove_marker_types  A comma-separated list of integers of
 *   #trace_marker_type_t marker types to remove.
 * @param[in] trim_before_timestamp  Trim records from the trace's initial timestamp
 *   up to its first timestamp whose value is greater or equal to this parameter.
 * @param[in] trim_after_timestamp  Trim records after the trace's first timestamp
 *   whose value is greater than this parameter.
 * @param[in] encodings2regdeps  If true, converts instruction encodings from the real ISA
 *   of the input trace to the #DR_ISA_REGDEPS synthetic ISA.
 * @param[in] verbose  Verbosity level for notifications.
