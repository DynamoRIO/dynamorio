/* memtrace_stream: an interface to access aspects of the full stream of memory
 * trace records.
 *
 * We had considered other avenues for analysis_tool_t to obtain things like
 * the record and instruction ordinals within the stream, in the presence of
 * skipping: we could add fields to memref but we'd either have to append
 * and have them at different offsets for each type or we'd have to break
 * compatibility to prepend every time we added more; or we could add parameters
 * to process_memref().  Passing an interface to the init routines seems
 * the simplest and most flexible.
