/* This microbenchmark suffers from a significant number of last-level cache
 * (LLC) misses. SW prefetching can significantly improve its performance.
 *
 * The cache miss analyzer can be used to identify the load instruction that
 * is suffering from most of the LLC misses in this microbenchmark. The analyzer
 * can also produce prefetching hints for this microbenchmark. To run the
 * analyzer on this microbenchmark and write the prefetching hints in a text
 * file called "rec.csv", perform the following:
 * * Compile the microbenchmark. Assuming g++ is the compiler being used:
 *   $ g++ -O3 -o stride_benchmark stride_benchmark.cpp
 * * Run the the analyzer:
 *   $ bin64/drrun -t drcachesim -simulator_type miss_analyzer -LL_miss_file rec.csv -- \
 *     stride_benchmark
