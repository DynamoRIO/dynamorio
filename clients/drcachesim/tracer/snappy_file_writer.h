/*
 * snappy_file_writer: writes small buffers to a snappy-compressed
 * file in a safe way for use during live tracing.
 *
 * Does not split up large buffers!  Will only write buffers guaranteed
 * to have a compressed size <= 64K: so a maximum uncompressed size
 * of ~53K, based on snappy::MaxCompressedLength.
 *
 * Files are written in the snappy framing format:
 *   https://github.com/google/snappy/blob/master/framing_format.txt
 *
 * This class it not thread-safe and the intent is for the user to create a
 * separate instance per thread.
 *
 * The snappy library allocates memory without parameterizing the allocator, meaning we
 * can't support it for static linking.  We give a warning in drmemtrace_client_main()
 * about this.  We could try to override the global allocator for some uses cases, but
 * that is not workable for statically linking into large C++ applications, and it can
 * be unsafe and seems to cause droption crashes in release build.
 * XXX: Send a patch to libsnappy to parameterize the allocator.
