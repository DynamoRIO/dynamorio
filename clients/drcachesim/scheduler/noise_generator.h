 * Generates synthetic #dynamorio::drmemtrace::memref_t trace records in a single-process
 * single-thread and presents them via an iterator interface to the scheduler.
 * These synthetic trace records are preceded by TRACE_TYPE_THREAD, TRACE_TYPE_PID,
 * TRACE_MARKER_TYPE_TIMESTAMP records and followed by TRACE_TYPE_THREAD_EXIT, as this is
 * the order of records that the scheduler expects. The value of
 * TRACE_MARKER_TYPE_TIMESTAMP is (ULONG_MAX - 1), which is not a
 * serial-or-interval-suited timestamp value for mixing with real workload inputs.
 * A serial analysis combined with real workload inputs would have these synthetic
 * records at the very end, while time interval analysis would not consider these records
 * unless the interval is very large (likely beyond the end of real input workloads).
 * Noise generation is suited for dynamic scheduling, where the scheduler will re-write
 * the values of TRACE_MARKER_TYPE_TIMESTAMP.
 * Note that this class does not support simultaneous use by concurrent threads.
