/* PR#4944: drreg_event_restore_state uses instr_get_eflags to get
 * instr eflags. This requires encoding the instr. We fail to
 * encode the syscall skip branch instr because the target is too
 * far from the tmp buf address to fit into the 26-bit offset. This
 * is not fatal as private_instr_encode works around the issue by
 * using instr_encode_ignore_reachability instead.
