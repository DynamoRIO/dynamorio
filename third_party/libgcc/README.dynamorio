These libgcc files were obtained from svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc r218764.

The GPL "GCC Runtime Library Exception" allows us to link these files into
our BSD library.

The file mappings are:
+ libgcc/config/arm/lib1funcs.S   => third_party/libgcc/arm/lib1funcs.S
+ libgcc/config/arm/bpabi.S       => third_party/libgcc/arm/bpabi.S
+ libgcc/config/arm/ieee754-sf.S  => third_party/libgcc/arm/ieee754-sf.S
+ libgcc/config/arm/ieee754-df.S  => third_party/libgcc/arm/ieee754-df.S
+ libgcc/libgcc2.c                => third_party/libgcc/udivmoddi4.c

Each file was untabified and had trailing blank lines removed.

Beyond whitespace changes, two files were changed as described below.

Here are the changes to lib1funcs.S:

For udivmoddi4.c, it contains the __udivmoddi4 and __moddi3 functions extracted from
libgcc2.c with the following lines added:
> /* This is extracted from gcc's libgcc/libgcc2.c with these typedefs added: */
> typedef short Wtype;
> typedef int DWtype;
> typedef unsigned int UWtype;
> typedef unsigned long long UDWtype;

> #endif
> typedef union {
>   struct DWstruct s;
>   DWtype ll;
> } DWunion;
