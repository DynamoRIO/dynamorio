\page page_tool DynamoRIO-Based Tools

A collection of powerful DynamoRIO-based tools are provided for direct use.
A tool can be invoked using the option \p -t with the tool name.
For example:
\code
bin64/drrun -t drcov -- application arg1 arg2
\endcode

Those interested in how the -t option works should see
the section \ref tool_frontend.

\page page_drmemory Dr. Memory Memory Debugging Tool

Dr. Memory is a memory monitoring tool capable of identifying
memory-related programming errors such as accesses of uninitialized memory,
accesses to unaddressable memory (including outside of allocated heap units
and heap underflow and overflow), accesses to freed memory, double frees,
memory leaks, and (on Windows) handle leaks, GDI API usage errors, and
accesses to un-reserved thread local storage slots.

<a href="http://drmemory.org">Dr. Memory is its own stand-alone tool</a>.
It is also included with DynamoRIO versions 5.0.0 and higher.  If this
documentation is part of a DynamoRIO public release, <a
href="../../drmemory/drmemory/docs/html/index.html">this link</a>
should point at the local documentation provided with the release package.
