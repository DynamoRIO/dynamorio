\page API_BT Code Manipulation API

The Code Manipulation API exposes the full power of DynamoRIO, allowing
tools to observe and modify the application's actual code stream as it
executes.  Modifications are not limited to trampoline insertion and can
include arbitrary changes.  We divide the API description into the
following sections:

- \ref sec_IR
- \ref sec_events_bt
- \ref sec_decode
- \ref sec_isa
- \ref sec_IR_utils
- \ref sec_reg_stolen
- \ref sec_translation
- \ref sec_predication

\section sec_IR Instruction Representation

The primary data structures involved in instruction manipulation are
the #instr_t, which represents a single instruction, and the \c
#instrlist_t, which is a linked list of instructions.  The header files
dr_ir_instrlist.h and dr_ir_instr.h list a number of functions that
operate on these data structures, including:

- Routines to create new instructions.
- Routines to iterate over an instruction's operands.
- Routines to iterate over an #instrlist_t.
- Routines to insert and remove an #instr_t from an #instrlist_t.

As we will see in the the \ref sec_events_bt section that follows, a
client usually interacts with #instrlist_t's in the form of \e basic \e
blocks or \e traces.  A basic block is a sequence of instructions that
terminates with a control transfer operation.  Traces are
frequently-executed sequences of basic blocks that DynamoRIO forms
dynamically as the application executes, i.e., \e hot code.
Collectively, we refer to basic blocks and traces as \e fragments.
Both basic blocks and traces present a linear view of control flow.
In other words, instruction sequences have a single entrance and one
or more exits.  This representation greatly simplifies analysis and is
a primary contributor to DynamoRIO's efficiency.

The instruction representation includes all of the operands, whether
implicit or explicit, and the condition code effects of each instruction.
This allows for analysis of liveness of registers and condition codes.

DynamoRIO's IR is mostly opaque to clients.  Key data structures have their
sizes exposed to allow for stack allocation, but their fields are opaque.  In
order to examine them, clients must call IR accessor routines in DynamoRIO.
While this makes DynamoRIO ABI compatible with prior releases, there is a
performance cost to calling through to an exported routine every time the
client touches an instruction.  Clients that are not concerned with ABI
compatibility can turn many of these export routine calls into inline functions
or macros by setting the CMake variable \c DynamoRIO_FAST_IR on or defining \p
DR_FAST_IR before including dr_api.h.  This removes some of the error checking
that DynamoRIO performs on calls from the client, so it should typically be
enabled only in a release build.  Furthermore, some of the macros evaluate their
arguments twice, so clients should avoid passing arguments with side effects.

When a new instruction is created using instr_create() or the
INSTR_CREATE_* or XINST_CREATE_* macros, if the instruction is added to the
#instrlist_t that is passed to the basic block or trace events, the heap
memory used by the instruction is automatically freed when that instruction
list is freed by DynamoRIO.  If instead an instruction is created on the
heap but used for other purposes and not added to a DynamoRIO-provided
instruction list, it should be freed by calling instr_destroy() or by
explicitly destroying a custom instruction list.

See \ref sec_decode for further information on creating instructions from
scratch, decoding, encoding, and disassembling instructions.  Typically
these instructions will be stored on the stack, using instr_init() and
instr_free() or instr_reset(), as shown in that section.

See \ref sec_IR_heap for further information on heap allocation for
instructions and safely using instructions in signal handlers.

\if level_of_detail
********************
\subsection sec_IR_adaptive Adaptive Level of Detail

It is costly to decode instructions.  Fortunately, DynamoRIO is
often only interested in high-level information for a subset of
instructions, such as just the control-flow instructions.  Each
instruction can be at one of five levels of detail.  To simplify clients,
DynamoRIO only passes them instructions at Level 3 or Level 4.
Internally, DynamoRIO uses all five levels:

\par Level 0: Raw Bundle

At Level 0, the #instr_t data structure holds raw bytes for group of
instructions decoded only enough to determine the final instruction
boundary:

<table border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=1>
<tr bgcolor="ffcc99"><td><tt>
8d 34 01 8b 46 0c 2b 46 1c 0f b7 4e 08 c1 e1 07 3b c1 0f 8d a2 0a 00 00
</tt></td></tr>
</table>

\par Level 1: Raw Individual

At Level 1, each #instr_t holds only one instruction, but has no more
information than raw bytes:

<table border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=1>
<tr><td bgcolor="ffcc99"><tt>8d 34 01</tt></td></tr>
<tr align="middle" bgcolor="ffffff"><td>&nbsp;|</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="ffcc99"><tt>8b 46 0c</tt></td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="ffcc99"><tt>0f 8d a2 0a 00 00</tt></td></tr>
</table>

\par Level 2: Opcode and Eflags

At Level 2, #instr_t has been decoded just enough to determine opcode and
flags effects (flags are important when analyzing code).  Raw bytes
are still used for encoding.  The flags effects below are only shown for
reading (R) or writing (W) the six arithmetic flags (Carry, Parity, Adjust,
Zero, Sign, and Overflow).

</table>

\par Level 3: Operands

A Level 3 #instr_t contains dynamically allocated arrays of source and
destination operands (dynamic because some ISA's are quite variable) that are now
filled in.  Raw bytes are still valid and are used for encoding.  This
level combines high-level information with quick encoding.

</table>

\par Level 4: Modified Operands

At the highest level, #instr_t has been modified at the operand level, or
has been created from operands, such that the raw bytes are no longer
valid.  The #instr_t must be fully encoded from its operands.

<table border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=1>

\par Basic Block Example

As an example of using different levels of detail, a basic block in
DynamoRIO is represented using a Level 0 #instr_t for all non-control-flow
instructions, and a Level 3 #instr_t for the block-ending control-flow
instruction:

<table border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=1>
<tr bgcolor="ffcc99"><td colspan=4><tt>
8d 34 01 8b 46 0c 2b 46 1c 0f b7 4e 08 c1 e1 07 3b c1
</tt></td></tr>
<tr align="middle" bgcolor="ffffff"><td>&nbsp;|</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="ffcc99"><tt>0f 8d a2 0a 00 00</tt></td>
  <td bgcolor="ccccff"><tt>jnl&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt></td>
  <td bgcolor="ccff66"><tt>$0x77f52269&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt></td>
  <td bgcolor="ccccff" align="middle"><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;RSO&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt></td></tr>
</table>

However, when a client registers for the basic block event, DynamoRIO
passes an #instrlist_t of all Level 3 #instr_t's, for simplicity.

\subsection sec_IR_AArch64 AArch64 IR Variations

DynamoRIO's IR representation of AArch64 NEON instructions uses an additional
immediate source operand to denote the width of the vector elements. The immediates
take the values #VECTOR_ELEM_WIDTH_BYTE (8 bit), #VECTOR_ELEM_WIDTH_HALF (16 bit),
#VECTOR_ELEM_WIDTH_SINGLE (32 bit) and #VECTOR_ELEM_WIDTH_DOUBLE (64 bit),
for vector instructions that require arrangement specifiers for their operands.
This is different from AArch64 assembly, where the element width is part of the
vector register operand. For example, floating point vector addition of two vectors
with 2 double elements is represented in assembly by
\code fadd v9.2d, v30.2d, v9.2d \endcode and in IR by
\code fadd %q30 %q9 $0x03 -> %q9 \endcode.

\section sec_events_bt Events

The core of a client's interaction with DynamoRIO occurs through <em>
event hooks</em>: the client registers its own callback routine (or \e
hook) for each event it is interested in.  DynamoRIO calls the
client's event hooks at appropriate times, giving the client access to
key actions during execution of the application.  The \ref sec_events
section describes events common to the entire DynamoRIO API. Here we
discuss the events specific to the Code Manipulation portion.

DynamoRIO provides two events related to application code fragments: one for
basic blocks and one for traces (see dr_register_bb_event() and
dr_register_trace_event()).  Through these fragment-creation hooks,
the client has the ability to inspect and modify any piece of code
that DynamoRIO emits before it executes.  Using the basic block hook,
a client sees \e all application code.  The trace-creation hook
provides a mechanism for clients to instrument only
frequently-executed code paths.

********************
\subsection sec_control_points Transformation Versus Execution Time

DynamoRIO's basic block and trace events are raised when the corresponding
application code is being transferred to the software code cache for
execution.  <em>No event is raised on each execution of this code from the
code cache</em>.  In a typical run, a particular block of code will only be
seen once in an event.  It will subsequently execute many times in the code
cache.

The point where the event is raised, where the application code is being
copied into the cache, is called <em>transformation time</em>.  This is
where a client can insert instrumentation to monitor the code, or can
modify the application code itself.  The repeated executions within the
code cache of this instrumented or modified code are referred to as
<em>execution time</em>.  It is important to understand the distinction.

The code manipulation API is highly efficient in that fragment creation
comprises a small part of DynamoRIO's overhead.  A client's instrumentation
time actions rarely add substantial overhead for most target applications.
Instead, it is extra actions taken by added instrumentation code acting at
execution time that affects efficiency.

********************
\subsection sec_events_bb Basic Block Creation

Through the basic block creation event, registered via
dr_register_bb_event(), the client has the ability to inspect and transform
any piece of code prior to its execution.  The client's hook receives
three parameters:

\code
dr_emit_flags_t new_block(void *drcontext, void *tag, instrlist_t *bb,
                          bool for_trace, bool translating);
\endcode

 - \c drcontext is a pointer to the input program's machine context.
   Clients should not inspect or modify the context; it is provided as
   an opaque pointer (i.e., <tt>void *</tt>) to be passed to API
   routines that require access to this internal data.

 - \c tag is a unique identifier for the basic block fragment.

 - \c bb is a pointer to the list of instructions that comprise the
   basic block.  Clients can examine, manipulate, or completely
   replace the instructions in the list.

 - \c for_trace indicates whether this callback is for a new basic block
   (false) or for adding a basic block to a trace being created (true).
   The client has the opportunity to either include the same modifications
   made to the standalone basic block, or to use different modifications,
   for the code in the trace.

 - \c translating indicates whether this callback is for basic block
   creation (false) or is for address translation (true). This is further
   explained in \ref sec_translation.

The return value of the basic block callback should generally be
DR_EMIT_DEFAULT; however, time-varying instrumentation or complex code
transformations may need to return DR_EMIT_STORE_TRANSLATIONS.  See \ref
sec_translation for further details.  A tool that wants to persist its code
to a file for fast re-use on subsequent runs can include the
DR_EMIT_PERSISTABLE flag in its return value.  See \ref sec_pcache for more
information.

To iterate over instructions in an #instrlist_t, use the \ref
instrlist_first(), \ref instrlist_last() (if necessary), and \ref
instr_get_next() routines. For example:

\code
dr_emit_flags_t new_block(void *drcontext, void *tag, instrlist_t *bb,
                          bool for_trace, bool translating)
{
  instr_t *instr, *next;
  for (instr = instrlist_first(bb);
       instr != NULL;
       instr = next) {
    next = instr_get_next(instr);
    /* do some processing on instr */
  }
  return DR_EMIT_DEFAULT;
}
\endcode

********************
\subsection sec_Meta Application Versus Meta Instructions

Changes to the instruction stream made by a client fall into two
categories: changes or additions that should be considered part of the
application's behavior, versus additions that are observational in nature
and are not acting on the application's behalf.  The latter are called \e
meta instructions.

Meta instructions are marked using these API routines:

\code
instr_set_meta()
instrlist_meta_preinsert()
instrlist_meta_postinsert()
instrlist_meta_append()
\endcode

DynamoRIO performs some processing on the basic block after the
client has finished with it, primarily modifying branches to ensure
that DynamoRIO retains control after execution.  It is important that
the client mark any control-flow instructions that it does not want treated
as application instructions as \e meta instructions. Doing so informs
DynamoRIO that these instructions should execute natively rather than
being trapped and redirected to new basic block fragments.

Through meta instructions, a client can add its own internal control flow
or make a call to a native routine.  The target of a meta call will not be
brought into the code
cache by DynamoRIO.  However, such native calls need to be careful to
remain transparent (see \ref sec_clean_call).

Meta instructions are normally observational, in which case they should not
fault and should have a NULL translation field.  It is possible to use meta
instructions that deliberately fault, or that could fault by accessing
application memory addresses, but only if the client handles all such
faults.  See \ref sec_translation for more information on fault handling.

Meta instructions are visible to client code, if using instr_get_next() and
instrlist_first(). To traverse only application (non-meta) instructions, a
client can use the following API functions instead:

\code
instr_get_next_app()
instrlist_first_app()
\endcode

We recommend that clients follow a disciplined model that separates application
code analysis versus insertion of instrumentation.  The \ref page_drmgr
Extension facilitates this by separating application transformation, application
analysis, and instrumentation.  However, even with this separation, label
instructions and in some cases other meta instructions (e.g., from
drwrap_replace_native()) are added during application transformation which
should be skipped during analysis.  Using instrlist_first_app() and
instr_get_next_app() is recommended during application analysis: it
automatically skips non-application (meta) instructions, which at that stage are
guaranteed to be either labels or to have no effect on register state or other
key aspects of application code analysis.

While DynamoRIO attempts to support arbitrary code transformations, its
internal operation requires that we impose the following limitations:

 - If there is more than one application branch, only the last can be
   conditional.
 - An application conditional branch must be the final instruction in the
   block.
 - There can only be one indirect branch (call, jump, or return) in
   a basic block, and it must be the final application branch in the block.
 - The exit control-flow of a block ending in a system call cannot be
   changed.
 - On AArch64, an ISB instruction (#OP_isb) must be the last instruction
   in its block.

Application instructions, or non-meta instructions, in addition to being
processed (and followed if control flow), are also considered safe points
for relocation for the rare times when DynamoRIO must move threads
around.  Thus a client should ensure that it is safe to re-start an
application instruction at the translation field address provided.

********************
\subsection sec_events_trace Trace Creation

DynamoRIO provides access to traces primarily through the trace-creation
event, registered via dr_register_trace_event().  It is important to note
that clients are not
required to employ the trace-creation event to ensure full instrumentation.
Rather, it is sufficient to perform all code modification using the basic
block event.  Any basic blocks that DynamoRIO chooses to place in a trace
will contain all client modifications (unless the client behaves
differently in the basic block hook when its \c for_trace parameter is
true).  The trace-creation event provides
a mechanism for clients to instrument \e hot code separately.

The parameters to the trace-creation event hook are nearly identical
to those of the basic block hook:

\code
dr_emit_flags_t new_trace(void *drcontext, void *tag, instrlist_t *trace,
                          bool translating);
\endcode

 - \c drcontext is a pointer to the input program's machine context.
   Clients should not inspect or modify the context; it is provided as
   an opaque pointer (i.e., <tt>void *</tt>) to be passed to API
   routines that require access to this internal data.

 - \c tag is a unique identifier for the trace fragment.

 - \c bb is a pointer to the list of instructions that comprise the
   trace.  Clients can examine, manipulate, or completely replace the
   instructions in the list.

 - \c translating indicates whether this callback is for trace creation
   (false) or is for address translation (true). This is further explained
   in \ref sec_translation.

The return value of the trace callback should generally be DR_EMIT_DEFAULT;
however, time-varying instrumentation or complex code transformations may
need to return DR_EMIT_STORE_TRANSLATIONS.  See \ref sec_translation for
further details.

DynamoRIO calls the client-supplied event hook each time a trace is
created, just before the trace is emitted into the code cache.
Additionally, as each constituent basic block is added to the trace,
DynamoRIO calls the basic block creation hook with the \p for_trace
parameter set to true.  In order to preserve basic block instrumentation
inside of traces, a client need only act identically with respect to the
\p for_trace parameter; it can ignore the trace event if its goal is to
place instrumentation on all code.

The constituent basic blocks will be stitched together prior to insertion
in the code cache: conditional branches will be realigned so that their
fall-through target remains on the trace, and inlined indirect branches
will be preceded by a comparison against the on-trace target.

If the basic block callback behaves differently based on the \p for_trace
parameter, different instrumentation will exist in the trace as opposed to
the standalone basic block.  If the basic block corresponds to the
application code at the start of the trace (i.e., it is a trace head), the
trace will shadow the basic block and the trace will be executed
preferentially.  If #dr_delete_fragment() is called, it will also delete
the trace first and may leave the basic block in place.  The flush routines
(#dr_flush_region(), #dr_delay_flush_region(), #dr_unlink_flush_region()),
however, will delete traces and basic blocks alike.

********************
\subsection sec_events_translation State Restoration

If a client is only adding instrumentation (meta instructions) that do not
reference application memory, and is not reordering or removing application
instructions, then it need not register for this event.  If, however, a
client is modifying application code or adding instructions that could
fault, the client must be capable of restoring the original context.
DynamoRIO calls a state restoration event, registered via
dr_register_restore_state_event() or dr_register_restore_state_ex_event(),
whenever it needs to translate a code cache context to an original
application context:

\code
void restore_state(void *drcontext, void *tag, dr_mcontext_t *mcontext,
                   bool restore_memory, bool app_code_consistent)
void restore_state_ex(void *drcontext, bool restore_memory,
                      dr_restore_state_info_t *info)
\endcode

See \ref sec_translation for further details.

********************
\subsection sec_events_del Basic Block and Trace Deletion

DynamoRIO can also provide notification of fragment deletion via
dr_register_delete_event().  The signature for this event callback is:

\code
void fragment_deleted(void *drcontext, void *tag);
\endcode

DynamoRIO calls this event hook each time it deletes a fragment from
the code cache.  Such information may be needed if the client
maintains its own data structures about emitted fragment code that
must be consistent across fragment deletions.

********************
\subsection sec_events_wow64 Special System Calls

For 32-bit applications on a 64-bit Windows kernel ("Windows-on-Windows-64"
or "WOW64"), DynamoRIO treats the indirect call from 32-bit system
libraries that transitions to WOW64 marshalling code as a system call, even
though there are a few 32-bit instructions executed afterward on some
versions of Windows.  Tools monitoring calls and returns will need to also
check for instructions being considered system calls.

\section sec_decode Decoding and Encoding

As discussed in \ref sec_events_bb and \ref sec_events_trace, a
client's primary interface to code inspection and manipulation is via
the basic block and trace hooks.  However, DynamoRIO also
exports a rich set of functions and data structures to decode and
encode instructions directly.  The following subsections overview this
functionality.


********************
\subsection sec_Decoding Decoding

DynamoRIO provides several routines for decoding and disassembling
instructions.  The most common method for decoding is the
decode() routine, which populates an #instr_t data structure with all
information about the instruction (e.g., opcode and operand
information).

When decoding instructions, clients must explicitly manage the \c
#instr_t data structure.  For example, the following code shows how to
use the instr_init(), instr_reset(), and instr_free() routines to
decode a sequence of arbritrary instructions:

\code
instr_t instr;
instr_init(&instr);
do {
  instr_reset(dcontext, &instr);
  pc = decode(dcontext, pc, &instr);
  /* check for invalid instr */
  if (pc == NULL)
    break;
  if (instr_writes_memory(&instr)) {
    /* do some processing */
  }
} while (pc < stop_pc);
instr_free(dcontext, &instr);
\endcode

DynamoRIO supports decoding multiple instruction set modes.
See \ref sec_isa for full details.

********************
\subsection sec_InstrGen Instruction Generation

Clients can construct instructions from scratch in two different ways:

 -# Using the INSTR_CREATE_opcode macros that fill
    in implicit operands automatically:
    \code
instr_t *instr = INSTR_CREATE_dec(dcontext, opnd_create_reg(REG_EDX));
    \endcode
 -# Specifying the opcode and all operands (including implicit
    operands):
    \code
instr_t *instr = instr_create(dcontext);
instr_set_opcode(instr, OP_dec);
instr_set_num_opnds(dcontext, instr, 1, 1);
instr_set_dst(instr, 0, opnd_create_reg(REG_EDX));
instr_set_src(instr, 0, opnd_create_reg(REG_EDX));
    \endcode

When using the second method, the exact order of operands and their
sizes must match the templates that DynamoRIO uses.  The
INSTR_CREATE_ macros in dr_ir_macros.h should be consulted to
determine the order.

********************
\subsection sec_Encoding Encoding

DynamoRIO's encoding routines take an instruction or list of
instructions and encode them into the corresponding bit pattern:

\code instr_encode(), instrlist_encode() \endcode

When encoding a control transfer instruction that targets another
instruction, two encoding passes are performed: one to find the offset
of the target instruction, and the other to link the control transfer
to the proper target offset.

DynamoRIO is capable of encoding multiple instruction set modes.
See \ref sec_isa for details.

********************
\subsection sec_disasm Disassembly

DynamoRIO provides several routines for printing instructions to a file or
a buffer.  These include disassemble(), opnd_disassemble(),
instr_disassemble(), instrlist_disassemble(), disassemble_with_info(),
disassemble_from_copy(), and disassemble_to_buffer().

The style of disassembly can be controlled through the
\ref op_syntax_intel "-syntax_intel" (for Intel-style disassembly),
\ref op_syntax_att "-syntax_att" (for AT&T-style disassembly), and
\ref op_syntax_arm "-syntax_arm" (for ARM-style disassembly) runtime
options, or the disassemble_set_syntax() function.  The default disassembly
style is DynamoRIO's custom style, which lists all operands (both implicit
and explicit).  The sources are listed first, followed by "->", and then
the destinations.  This provides more information than any of the other
formats.

********************
\subsection sec_IR_heap Instruction Heap Allocation

DynamoRIO's IR is designed for efficiency and a small footprint.  By
default, space for operands is dynamically allocated from the heap.
This can be problematic when using instructions in fragile locations
such as signal handlers.  DR provides a separate instruction structure
for such situations: #instr_noalloc_t.  This structure contains
built-in storage for all possible operand slots and for temporary
encoding space, avoiding heap allocation when used for decoding or
encoding.

To use #instr_noalloc_t, declare it and then obtain a pointer to it
as an #instr_t structure for use with API functions:

\code
instr_noalloc_t noalloc;
instr_noalloc_init(dcontext, &noalloc);
instr_t *instr = instr_from_noalloc(&noalloc);
pc = decode(dcontext, ptr, instr);
\endcode

No freeing is required.  To re-use the same no-alloc structure,
instr_reset() can be called on its #instr_t pointer.

\endhtmlonly
\section sec_isa Instruction Set Modes

Some architectures support multiple instruction set modes.  The AMD64 build
of DynamoRIO is capable of decoding and encoding 32-bit IA-32 instructions,
while the 32-bit ARM build is capable of decoding and encoding both ARM and
Thumb modes.

In DynamoRIO, each thread has a current mode that is used to determine how
to interpret instructions while decoding, whose default matches the
DynamoRIO build.  The dr_set_isa_mode() routine changes the current mode,
while dr_get_isa_mode() queries the current mode.

Additionally, each instruction contains a flag indicating the mode in which
it should be encoded.  When an instruction is created or decoded, the
instruction's flag is set to the thread's current mode.  It can be queried
with instr_get_isa_mode() and changed with instr_set_isa_mode().

********************
\subsection sec_64bit 64-bit Versus 32-bit Instructions

The 64-bit build of DynamoRIO uses 64-bit decoding and encoding by
default, while the 32-bit build uses 32-bit.  The 64-bit build is also
capable of decoding and encoding 32-bit instructions.

For a 64-bit build of DynamoRIO, the instruction creation macros all use
64-bit-sized registers.  The recommended model when generating 32-bit code
is to use the macros to create an instruction list and before encoding to
call instr_set_isa_mode(DR_ISA_IA32) and instr_shrink_to_32_bits() on each
instruction.  Naturally any instruction that differs in more than register
selection must be special-cased.

********************
\subsection sec_thumb Thumb Mode Addresses

For 32-bit ARM, target addresses passed as event callbacks, as clean
call targets, or as dr_redirect_execution() targets should have
their least significant bit set to 1 if they need to be executed
in Thumb mode (#DR_ISA_ARM_THUMB).  Addresses obtained via
dr_get_proc_address(), or function pointers at the source code level,
should automatically have this property.  dr_app_pc_as_jump_target() can
also be used to construct the proper address from an aligned value.

When decoding, if the target address has its least significant bit set to
1, the decoder switches to Thumb mode for the duration of the decoding,
regardless of the current thread's mode.

\section sec_IR_utils Utilities

In addition to instruction decoding and encoding, the API includes
several higher-level routines to facilitate code instrumentation.
These include the following:

- Routines to insert clean calls to client-defined functions.
- Routines to instrument control-flow instructions.
- Routines to spill registers to DynamoRIO's thread-private spill
  slots.
- Routines to quickly save and restore arithmetic flags,
  floating-point state, and MMX/SSE registers.

The following subsections describe these routines in more detail.

********************
\subsection sec_clean_call Clean Calls

To make it easy to insert code into the application instruction
stream, DynamoRIO provides a <em>clean call</em> mechanism, which
allows insertion of a transparent call to a client routine.
The dr_insert_clean_call() routine takes care of switching to a clean
stack, setting up arguments to a call and making the call, optionally
preserving floating point state, and preserving application state across
the entire sequence.

Here is an example of inserting a clean call to the \c at_mbr function:

\code
if (instr_is_mbr(instr)) {
  app_pc address = instr_get_app_pc(instr);
  uint opcode = instr_get_opcode(instr);
  instr_t *nxt = instr_get_next(instr);
  dr_insert_clean_call(drcontext, ilist, nxt, (void *) at_mbr,
                       false/*don't need to save fp state*/,
                       2 /* 2 parameters */,
                       /* opcode is 1st parameter */
                       OPND_CREATE_INT32(opcode),
                       /* address is 2nd parameter */
                       OPND_CREATE_INTPTR(address));
}
\endcode

Through this mechanism, clients can write analysis code in C or other
high-level languages and easily insert calls to these routines in the
instruction stream.  Note, however, that saving and restoring machine state
is an expensive operation.  Performance-critical operations should be
inlined for maximum efficiency.

The stack that DynamoRIO switches to for clean calls is relatively small:
only 20KB by default.  Clients can increase the size of the stack with the
\ref op_stack_size "-stack_size" runtime option.  Clients should also
avoid keeping persistent state on the clean call stack, as it is wiped
clean at the start of each clean call.

The saved interrupted application state can be accessed using
dr_get_mcontext() and modified using dr_set_mcontext().

For performance reasons, clean calls do not save or restore floating point,
MMX, or SSE state by default.  If the clean callee is using floating point
or multimedia operations, it should request that the clean call mechanism
preserve the floating point state through the appropriate parameter to
dr_insert_clean_call().  See also
\ref sec_trans_floating_point "Floating Point State, MMX, and SSE Transparency".

If more detailed control over the call sequence is desired, it can be
broken down into its constituent pieces:

 - dr_prepare_for_call()
 - Optionally, dr_insert_save_fpstate()
 - dr_insert_call()
 - Optionally, dr_insert_restore_fpstate()
 - dr_cleanup_after_call()

DynamoRIO analyzes the callee target of each clean call and attempts to
reduce the context switch size and, if the callee is simple enough, to
automatically inline it.  This analysis and potential inlining works best
when the callee is fully optimized.  Thus, we recommend using high
optimization levels in clients, even when running DynamoRIO itself in debug
build in order to examine whether callees are being inlined.  See \ref
op_cleancall "-opt_cleancall" for information on how to adjust the
aggressiveness of these optimizations and for a list of specific conditions
that affect inlining.

********************
\subsection sec_state State Preservation

To facilitate code transformations, DynamoRIO makes available its register
spill slots and other state preservation functionality.  It exports API
routines for saving and restoring registers to and from thread-local spill
slots:

\code dr_save_reg(), dr_restore_reg(), and dr_reg_spill_slot_opnd() \endcode

The values stored in these spill slots remain valid until the next application
(i.e. non-meta) instruction and as such can be accessed from clean calls using:

\code dr_read_saved_reg(), dr_write_saved_reg() \endcode

For longer term persistence DynamoRIO also provides a generic dedicated
thread-local storage field for use by clients, making it easy to write
thread-aware clients.  From C code, use:

\code dr_get_tls_field(), dr_set_tls_field() \endcode

To access this thread-local field from the code cache, use the following
routines to generate the necessary code:

\code dr_insert_read_tls_field(), dr_insert_write_tls_field() \endcode

Since saving and restoring the \c eflags register is required for almost
all code transformations, and since it is difficult to do so efficiently,
we export routines that use our efficient method of arithmetic flag
preservation:

\code dr_save_arith_flags(), dr_restore_arith_flags() \endcode

As just discussed in \ref sec_clean_call, we also export convenience
routines for making \e clean (i.e., transparent) native calls from the code
cache, as well as floating point and multimedia state preservation.


********************
\subsection sec_branch_instru Branch Instrumentation

DynamoRIO provides explicit support for instrumenting call
instructions, direct (or unconditional) branches, indirect (or
multi-way) branches, and conditional branches.  These convenience
routines insert clean calls to client-provided methods, passing as
arguments the instruction pc and target pc of each control transfer,
along with taken or not taken information for conditional branches:

\code
dr_insert_call_instrumentation()
dr_insert_ubr_instrumentation()
dr_insert_mbr_instrumentation()
dr_insert_cbr_instrumentation()
\endcode


********************
\subsection sec_adaptive Dynamic Instrumentation

DynamoRIO allows a client to dynamically adjust its instrumentation
by providing a routine to flush all cached fragments corresponding to
an application code region and register (or unregister) instrumentation
event callbacks:

\code
dr_flush_region_ex()
\endcode

The client should provide a callback to this routine, that unregisters
old instrumentation event callbacks, and registers new ones.

In order to directly modify the instrumentation on a particular fragment
(as opposed to replacing instrumentation on all copies of fragments
corresponding to particular application code), DynamoRIO also supports
directly replacing an existing fragment with a new #instrlist_t:

\code
dr_replace_fragment()
\endcode

However, this routine is only supported when running with the \ref
op_thread_priv "-thread_private" runtime option, and it replaces the
fragment for the current thread only.  A client can call this routine even
while inside the to-be-replaced fragment (e.g., in a clean call from inside
the fragment).  In this scenario, the old fragment is executed to
completion and the new code is inserted before the next execution.

For example usage, see the client sample \ref sec_ex3.

********************
\subsection sec_custom_traces Custom Traces

DynamoRIO combines frequently executed sequences of basic blocks into
<em>traces</em>.  It uses a simple profiling scheme based on <em>trace
heads</em>, which are the targets of backward branches or exits from
existing traces.  Execution counters are kept for each trace head.  Once a
head crosses a threshold, the next sequence of basic blocks that are
executed becomes a new trace.

DynamoRIO allows a client to build custom traces by marking its own trace
heads (<em>in addition</em> to DynamoRIO's normal trace heads) and
deciding when to end traces.  If a client registers for the following
event, DynamoRIO will call its hook before extending a trace (with tag \c
trace_tag) with a new basic block (with tag \c next_tag):

\code
int query_end_trace(void *drcontext, void *trace_tag, void *next_tag);
\endcode

The client hook returns one of these values:
 - CUSTOM_TRACE_DR_DECIDES = use standard termination criteria
 - CUSTOM_TRACE_END_NOW = end trace now
 - CUSTOM_TRACE_CONTINUE = do not end trace

If using standard termination criteria, DynamoRIO ends the trace if it
reaches a trace head or another trace (or certain corner-case basic blocks
that cannot be part of a trace).

The client can also mark any basic block as a trace head with
\code dr_mark_trace_head() \endcode

For example usage, see the callee-inlining client sample \ref sec_ex5.

\if custom_stubs
********************
\subsection sec_custom_stubs Custom Exit Stubs

An exit cti can be given an #instrlist_t to be prepended to the standard
exit stub.  There are set and get methods for this custom exit stub code:

\code
void instr_set_exit_stub_code(instr_t *instr, instrlist_t *stub);
instrlist_t *instr_exit_stub_code(instr_t *instr);
\endcode

When a fragment is re-decoded, e.g. when being appended to a trace or when
re-decoded using dr_decode_fragment, the custom stubs are regenerated and
added to the owning exit cti's.

\section sec_reg_stolen Register Stolen by DynamoRIO

On some architectures, e.g., ARM and AArch64, DynamoRIO steals a register for
holding the base of DynamoRIO's own TLS (Thread-Local Storage).
DynamoRIO guarantees the correctness of the application execution by saving
and restoring the stolen register's value before and after that register is used
by each application instruction.
DynamoRIO also guarantees the stolen register's value is stored in the
application machine context (dr_mcontext_t) for client use at event callbacks or
clean calls.
However, DynamoRIO exposes the stolen register to the client and places the burden
on the client to ensure the correctness of its instrumentation.

The client can use reg_is_stolen() or dr_get_stolen_reg() to identify the stolen
register. To use the application value of the stolen register in the inserted code,
the client must first use dr_insert_get_stolen_reg_value() to insert code to get
the value into another register.
Otherwise, the TLS base value might be used instead.
Similarly, the client should use dr_insert_set_stolen_reg_value() to set the
application value of the stolen register.

\endhtmlonly
\section sec_translation State Translation

To support transparent fault handling, DynamoRIO must translate a fault in
the code cache into a fault at the corresponding application address.
DynamoRIO must also be able to translate when a suspended thread is
examined by the application or by DynamoRIO itself for internal
synchronization purposes.

If a client is only adding observational instrumentation (i.e., \ref
sec_Meta) (which should not fault) and is not modifying, reordering, or
removing application instructions, these details can be ignored.  In that
case the client's basic block and trace callbacks should return
#DR_EMIT_DEFAULT in addition to being deterministic and idempotent (i.e.,
DynamoRIO should be able to repeatedly call the callback and receive back
the same resulting instruction list, with no net state changes to the
client).

If a client is performing modifications, then in order for DynamoRIO to
properly translate a code cache address the client must use
instr_set_translation() (chainable via INSTR_XL8()) in the basic block and
trace creation callbacks to set the corresponding application address for
each added meta instruction that can fault, each modified instruction, and
each added application instruction.  The
translation value is the application address that should be presented to
the application as the faulting address, or the application address that
should be restarted after a suspend.  Currently the translation address
must be within the existing range of source addresses for the basic block
or trace.

There are two methods for using the translated addresses:

-# Return #DR_EMIT_STORE_TRANSLATIONS from the basic block creation
   callback.  DR will then store the translation addresses and use
   the stored information on a fault.  The basic block callback for
   \p tag will not be called with \p translating set to true.  Note
   that unless #DR_EMIT_STORE_TRANSLATIONS is also returned for \p
   for_trace calls (or #DR_EMIT_STORE_TRANSLATIONS is returned in
   the trace callback), each constituent block comprising the trace
   will need to be re-created with both \p for_trace and \p
   translating set to true.  Storing translations uses additional
   memory that can be significant: up to 20% in some cases, as it
   prevents DR from using its simple data structures and forces it
   to fall back to its complex, corner-case design.  This is why DR
   does not store all translations by default.
-# Return #DR_EMIT_DEFAULT from the basic block or trace creation callback.
   DynamoRIO will then call the callback again during fault translation
   with \p translating set to true.  All modifications to the instruction
   list that were performed on the creation callback must be repeated on
   the translating callback.  This option is only posible when basic block
   modifications are deterministic and idempotent, but it saves memory.
   Naturally, global state changes triggered by block creation should be
   wrapped in checks for \p translating being false.  Even in this case,
   instr_set_translation() should be called for appropriate instructions even
   when \p translating is false, as DynamoRIO may decide to store the
   translations at creation time for reasons of its own.

Furthermore, if the client's modifications change any part of the machine
state besides the program counter, the client should use
dr_register_restore_state_event() or dr_register_restore_state_ex_event()
(see \ref sec_events_translation) to restore the registers to their
original application values. DR attempts to reconstruct the #instrlist_t
for the faulting fragment; this list contains all instrs added by the
basic block event(s) with \p translating set to true, and also DR's own
mangling of some instrs. If this reconstructed #instrlist_t is available,
it will be passed on to the registered callback as part of
#dr_fault_fragment_info_t in #dr_restore_state_info_t. It may not be
available when some or all clients returned #DR_EMIT_STORE_TRANSLATIONS,
or for DR internal reasons when the app code may not be consistent: for
pending deletion or self-modifying fragments.

For meta instructions that do not reference application memory (i.e., they
should not fault), leave the translation field as NULL.  A NULL value
instructs DynamoRIO to use the subsequent application instruction's
translation as the application address, and to fail when translating the
full state.  Since the full state will only be needed when relocating a
thread (as stated, there will not be a fault here), failure indicates that
this is not a valid relocation point, and DynamoRIO's thread
synchronization scheme will use another spot.  If the translation field is
set to a non-NULL value, the client should be willing to also restore the
rest of the machine state at that point (restore spilled registers, etc.)
via #dr_register_restore_state_event() or
#dr_register_restore_state_ex_event().  This is necessary for meta
instructions that reference application memory or that may deliberately fault
when accessing client memory.  DynamoRIO takes care of
such potentially-faulting instructions added by its own API routines
(#dr_insert_clean_call() arguments that reference application data,
#dr_insert_mbr_instrumentation()'s read of application indirect branch
data, etc.)

Here is an example of using the INSTR_XL8 macro to set the translation
field for a meta instruction:

\code
#define PREM instrlist_meta_preinsert

app_pc xl8 = instr_get_app_pc(inst);
PREM(bb, inst, INSTR_XL8(INSTR_CREATE_mov_st(drcontext, dst, src), xl8));
\endcode

\section sec_predication Conditionally Executed Instructions

DynamoRIO models conditionally executed, or "predicated", instructions as
regular instructions with extra predication attributes.  Use
instr_is_predicated() to determine whether an instruction is conditionally
executed.  If so, use instr_get_predicate() to determine the type of
condition.  At execution time, instr_predicate_triggered() can be used to
query whether an instruction will execute or not.

The degree of conditional execution varies.  In some cases, when an
instruction is not executed, it will not read any source operands nor write
any destination operands.  In other cases, the condition on which it depends
involves the value of a source operand (e.g., OP_bsf or OP_maskmovq).
However, all conditionally executed instructions share the same property
that their destination operands are conditionally written.  This does not
apply to eflags, which are written to unconditionally by some conditional
instructions.

To aid in analyzing liveness and other properties of application code, all
API routines that query whether registers or flags are written take a
parameter of type #dr_opnd_query_flags_t that controls how to treat
conditionally accessed operands: whether to include them or skip them.

API routines that operate on raw instruction information, such as
instr_num_dsts(), include all possible operands.  Clients should explicitly
query instr_is_predicated() when using API routines that do not take in
#dr_opnd_query_flags_t.

As shorthand for emitting instrumentation that necessarily uses the same
predicate as the current instruction, \p instrlist_set_auto_predicate() is
provided which will predicate all instructions inserted into an instruction
list. Although writing to aflags is strictly forbidden, as is meta control
flow, internal DR components such as \p dr_insert_clean_call() will gracefully
handle this auto-predication setting and are safe for use with it.

\p instrlist_get_auto_predicate() similarly may be used to query the current
predicate desired for auto predication.

********************
\subsection sec_it_blocks IT Blocks

On ARM AArch32, the Thumb mode includes conditional groups of instructions
called IT blocks.  The #OP_it header instruction indicates how many
instructions are in the block and the direction of each instruction's
conditional.  Thus, inserting instrumentation inside the block without
updating the header results in an unencodable instruction list.  To solve
this, we provide two API routines: dr_remove_it_instrs() and
dr_insert_it_instrs().  The first simply removes the headers.  Since the
individual instructions from the blocks are marked with their condition in
our IR, the header is not necessary for tools to analyze the instructions.
The second re-instates the headers, creating a legal instruction list.
This re-creation of the proper IT block headers occurs as a final phase in
drmgr, after the instru2instru event.  This means that the original #OP_it
header instructions are present for clients to observe in the analysis
phase.

Clients not using drmgr can call dr_remove_it_instrs() and then
dr_insert_it_instrs() on their own.

\section sec_ldrex Exclusive Monitor Instrumentation

On ARM and AArch64, a load-exclusive store-exclusive pair of
instructions has some constraints that make inserting instrumentation
in between the pair challenging.  ARM/AArch64 hardware requires that
an application minimize memory operations in between the
load-exclusive and store-exclusive and minimize the total number of
instructions in between.  Violating this can result in failure to
acquire the desired exclusive monitor, which is always done in a loop
and can result in a non-terminating loop when the application is run
with instrumentation.

Inserting a few memory references in between the pair works
on some but not all hardware. Inserting something heavyweight like a clean
call is very likely to result in a non-terminating loop.

By default, DynamoRIO converts each such sequence to a compare-and-swap
sequence which can handle any amount of added instrumentation.
However, compare-and-swap is not semantically identical: it does not
detect "ABA" changes and could cause errors in lock-free data
structures or other application constructs.  This compare-and-swap
conversion can be disabled with the runtime option \ref op_ldstex2cas
"no_ldstex2cas".

If compare-and-swap conversion must be disabled, we recommend using
inlined instrumentation with at most a few memory references in such
regions, rather than clean calls.  In general, this is the best
performing strategy anyway for heavyweight tools that want to
instrument every instruction.  Take a look at the memtrace_simple and
instrace_simple samples, which check for instr_is_exclusive_store() to
avoid a clean call in between.  However, even this is not enough on
some hardware, where instrumentation would have to be shifted to before
and/or after the monitor region.  The runtime option
"-unsafe_build_ldstex" may be useful on AArch64 hardware that does not
allow any loads or stores between an exclusive load and the
corresponding exclusive store. With this option DynamoRIO tries to
turn a sequence of instructions containing an exclusive load/store
pair into a macro-instruction, which prevents any loads and stores
from being inserted, but also prevents any of the instructions
involved from being instrumented.

\section sec_rseq Restartable Sequence Instrumentation Constraints

The Linux kernel supports special code regions called restartable
sequences.  This "rseq" feature is challenging to support under
instrumentation due to the tight restrictions on operations inside the
sequence.  Instrumentation inserted in the sequence would need to be
designed to be restartable as well, with a single commit point.  Meeting
such requirements is unrealistic for most instrumentation.  Instead, DR
provides a "run twice" solution where the sequence is first executed as
regular code with regular instrumentation up to the commit point.  Then the
sequence is restarted and executed without instrumentation to perform the
commit.

This run-twice approach is subject to the following limitations:

- Only x86 and aarch64 are supported for now, and 32-bit x86 is not as well-tested.
- The application must store an rseq_cs struct for each rseq region in a
  section of its binary named "__rseq_cs", optionally with an "__rseq_cs_ptr_array"
  section of pointers into the __rseq_cs section, per established conventions.
  These sections must be located in loaded segments.
- The application must use static thread-local storage for its struct rseq registrations.
- The application must use the same signature for every rseq system call.
- Each rseq region's code must never be also executed as a non-restartable sequence.
- Each rseq region must handle being directly restarted without its
  abort handler being called (with the machine state restored: though just the
  general-purpose registers as described in the limitation below).
- Each memory store instruction inside an rseq region must have no other side
  effects: it must only write to memory and not to any registers.
  For example, a push instruction which both writes to memory and the
  stack pointer register is not supported.
  An exception is a pre-indexed or post-indexed writeback store, which is
  supported.
- Each rseq region's code must end with a fall-through (non-control-flow)
  instruction.
- Indirect branches that do not exit the rseq region are not allowed.
- Each rseq region must be entered only from the top, with no branches from outside
  the region targeting a point inside the region.
- No system calls are allowed inside rseq regions.
- No call instructions are allowed inside rseq regions.
- The only register inputs to an rseq region, or registers written inside an rseq
  region whose values are then read afterward, must be general-purpose registers.
- The instrumented execution of the rseq region may not perfectly reflect
  the native behavior of the application.  The instrumentation will never see
  an abort anywhere but just prior to the committing store.
  Additionally, memory addresses may be wrong if they are based on
  the live (as opposed to cached at the rseq region entrance) underlying cpuid
  and a migration occurred mid-region.  These are minor and
  acceptable for most tools (especially given that there is no better alternative).

Some of these limitations are explicitly checked, and DR will exit with an error
message if they are not met.  However, not all are efficiently verifiable.
If an application does not satisfy these limitations, the \ref
op_disable_rseq "disable_rseq" runtime option may be used to return ENOSYS,
which can provide a workaround for applications which have fallback code
for kernels where rseq is not supported.

\section sec_pcache Persisting Code

Decoding, instrumenting, and emitting code into the code cache takes time.
Short-running applications, or applications that execute large amounts of
code with little code re-use, can incur noticeable overhead when run under
DynamoRIO.  One solution is to write the code cache to a file for fast
re-use on subsequent runs by simply loading the file.  DynamoRIO provides
support for tools to persist their instrumented code.

First, the \ref op_persist "-persist" runtime option, and optionally \p
-persist_dir, must be set in order for any caches to be persisted.  Only
basic block persistence is supported: no traces.  In the presence of a
client, basic blocks by default are not persisted.  Only if the return
value of the basic block event callback includes the DR_EMIT_PERSISTABLE
flag is a block eligible for persistence.  Even then, there are further
constraints on persistence, as only simple blocks are persistable.

Persisted caches end in the extension \p .dpc, for DynamoRIO Persisted
Cache, and are stored in the directory specified by the \p -persist_dir
runtime option, or the log directory if unspecified, inside a per-user
subdirectory.

A client may need to store data in the persisted file in order to
determine whether it is re-usable when loaded again, or to provide
generated code or other auxiliary data or code that the persisted code
requires.  A set of events are provided for this purpose.  These events
allow a client to store three types of data in a persisted file, beyond
instrumented code inside each basic block: read-only data, executed code
(outside of basic blocks), and writable data.  The types of data are
separated because the file is laid out in different protection zones.
Read-only data can be added using dr_register_persist_ro(), executable code
using dr_register_persist_rx(), and writable data using
dr_register_persist_rw().  Additionally, the basic blocks to be persisted
can be patched using dr_register_persist_patch().

Whenever code is about to be persisted, DynamoRIO will call all of the
registered events for that module.  A user data parameter can be used to
share information across the event callbacks.

Clients are cautioned to ensure their instrumentation is either
position-independent or properly patched to operate correctly when the
client library base or the persisted code addresses change.  For example,
if inserted instrumentation includes calls or jumps into the client
library, these can be persisted unchanged if the client also stores its
base address in the read-only section and in the resurrection callback
checks it against its current base address.  On a mismatch, the persisted
file must be rejected.  A more sophisticated approach requires indirection,
position independence in the code, or patching.

DynamoRIO itself ensures that a persisted file is only re-used if its
application module has not changed, if the set of clients in use is
identical to those present on creation of the file, and that the TLS offset
is identical.  The application module check currently includes the base
address on Windows, which precludes re-using persisted files for libraries
loaded at different addresses via ASLR.  (In the future we plan to provide
application relocation support, but it is not there today.).  The client
check is based on the absolute paths.  If a client needs to validate based
on its runtime options, or do a version check based on its own changing
instrumentation, it must do that on its own in the event callbacks.  The
TLS check ensures that TLS scratch slots are identical.  DynamoRIO also
ensures that any runtime options that affect persistent code (such as
whether traces are enabled) are identical.
