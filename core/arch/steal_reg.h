 * you can see in the .c file, we're pretty conservative with this
 * optimization.  We're really only concerned with the stretches where
 * edi is involved in a calculation.  As such, whenever an instruction
 * doesn't use edi, we place dcontext->xbx back in ebx.  We also keep
 * track of when the edi value in ebx matches dcontext->xdi (true when
 * bit 1 of flags is asserted) so that we don't have to dump ebx into
 * dcontext->xdi unnecessarily. */
