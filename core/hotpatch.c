 * @param       probes  Pointer to an array of probe descriptors of type
 *                      dr_probe_desc_t.  Each descriptor describes the
 *                      location of the probe, the callback function and other
 *                      data.  This is an in/out parameter, see dr_probe_desc_t
 *                      for details.  If probes isn't NULL, points to valid
 *                      memory and num_probes is greater than 0, id and status
 *                      for each probe are set in the corresponding
 *                      dr_probe_desc_t.  If probes is NULL or num_probes is 0,
 *                      nothing is set in probes.  Invalid memory may trigger
 *                      an exception.
 *
 * @param [in]  num_probes  Specifies the number of probe descriptors in
 *                          the array pointed to by probes.
 *
 * \remarks
 * If a probe definition is invalid, it will not be registered, i.e. DynamoRIO
 *  will not retain its definition.  The error code will be returned in the
 *  status field in of that probe's dr_probe_desc_t element and the
 *  corresponding id field in dr_probe_desc_t is set to NULL.
 *
 * \remarks
 * When a client calls dr_register_probes() from dr_client_main() (which is the
 *  earliest dr_register_probes() can be called), not all valid probes are
 *  guaranteed to be inserted upon retrun from dr_register_probes().  Some
 *  valid probes may not be inserted if the target module has not been loaded,
 *  the insertion point is not executable, or the memory is otherwise
 *  inaccessible.  In such cases, DynamoRIO retains all valid probe
 *  information and inserts these probes when the memory locations become
 *  available.
 *
 * \remarks
 * When dr_register_probes() is called after dr_client_main(), the behavior is
 *  identical to being called from dr_client_main() with one caveat: even valid probes
 *  aren't guaranteed to be registered when dr_register_probes() returns.
 *  However, valid probes will be registered within a few milliseconds usually.
 *  To prevent performance and potential deadlock issues, it is recommended
 *  that a client shouldn't wait in a loop till the probe status changes.
 *  Instead, clients should check probe status at a later callback.
 *
 * \remarks
 * A client can determine the status of a registered probe in one of two ways.
 *  1) Read it from the status field in the associated dr_probe_desc_t element
 *  when dr_register_probes() returns, or 2) call dr_get_probe_status() with
 *  the id of the probe.
 *
 * \remarks
 * To add, remove or update currently registered probes dr_register_probes()
 *  should be called again with a new set of probe definitions.  The new list
 *  of probes completely replaces the existing probes.  That is, existing
 *  probes not specified in the new list are removed from the process.
 *
 * \remarks
 * The probe insertion address has limitations.  5 bytes beginning at the start
 *  of a probe insertion address should have specific characteristics.  No
 *  instruction should straddle this start of this region, i.e., the probe
 *  insertion address should be the beginning of an instruction.  Also, no flow
 *  of control should jump into the middle of this 5 byte region beginning at
 *  the probe insertion address.  Further, there should be no int instructions
 *  in this region.  call and jump instructions are allowed in this region as
 *  long as they don't terminate before the end of the region, i.e., no other
 *  instruction should start after them in this region (as it will allow
 *  control flow to return to the middle of this region).  If these rules are
 *  not adhered to the results are be unspecified; may result in process crash.
 *  The above mentioned restrictions hold only when using \ref API_probe not
 *  when using API_BT or both simultaneously.
 *
 * \remarks
 * If only the \ref API_probe is used 5 bytes starting at the probe insertion
 *  address will be modified.  If the process will read this memory then the
 *  probe should be moved to another location or removed to avoid unknown
 *  changes in process behavior.  If the client will read this memory, then it
 *  has to do so before requesting probe insertion.
 *
