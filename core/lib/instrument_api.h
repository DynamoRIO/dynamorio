DR_API
/**
 * Registers a callback function for the basic block event.  DR calls
 * \p func before inserting a new basic block into the code cache.
 * When adding a basic block to a new trace, DR calls \p func again
 * with \p for_trace set to true, giving the client the opportunity to
 * keep its same instrumentation in the trace, or to change it.  The
 * original basic block's instrumentation is unchanged by whatever
 * action is taken in the \p for_trace call.
 *
 * DR constructs <em>dynamic basic blocks</em>, which are distinct
 * from a compiler's classic basic blocks.  DR does not know all entry
 * points ahead of time, and will end up duplicating the tail of a
 * basic block if a later entry point is discovered that targets the
 * middle of a block created earlier, or if a later entry point
 * targets straight-line code that falls through into code already
 * present in a block.
 *
 * DR may call \p func again if it needs to translate from code cache
 * addresses back to application addresses, which happens on faulting
 * instructions as well as in certain situations involving suspended
 * threads or forcibly relocated threads.  The \p translating
 * parameter distinguishes the two types of calls and is further
 * explained below.
 *
 * - \p drcontext is a pointer to the input program's machine context.
 * Clients should not inspect or modify the context; it is provided as
 * an opaque pointer (i.e., <tt>void *</tt>) to be passed to API
 * routines that require access to this internal data.
 * drcontext is specific to the current thread, but in normal
 * configurations the basic block being created is thread-shared: thus,
 * when allocating data structures with the same lifetime as the
 * basic block, usually global heap (#dr_global_alloc()) is a better
 * choice than heap tied to the thread that happened to first create
 * the basic block (#dr_thread_alloc()).  Thread-private heap is fine
 * for temporary structures such as instr_t and instrlist_t.
 *
 * - \p tag is a unique identifier for the basic block fragment.
 * Use dr_fragment_app_pc() to translate it to an application address.
 * - \p bb is a pointer to the list of instructions that comprise the
 * basic block.  Clients can examine, manipulate, or completely
 * replace the instructions in the list.
 *
 * - \p translating indicates whether this callback is for basic block
 * creation (false) or is for address translation (true).  This is
 * further explained below.
 *
 * \return a #dr_emit_flags_t flag.
 *
 * The user is free to inspect and modify the block before it
 * executes, but must adhere to the following restrictions:
 * - If there is more than one application branch, only the last can be
 * conditional.
 * - An application conditional branch must be the final
 * instruction in the block.
 * - An application direct call must be the final
 * instruction in the block unless it is inserted by DR for elision and the
 * subsequent instructions are the callee.
 * - There can only be one indirect branch (call, jump, or return) in
 * a basic block, and it must be the final instruction in the
 * block.
 * - There can only be one far branch (call, jump, or return) in
 * a basic block, and it must be the final instruction in the
 * block.
 * - The exit control-flow of a block ending in a system call or
 * int instruction cannot be changed, nor can instructions be inserted
 * after the system call or int instruction itself, unless
 * the system call or int instruction is removed entirely.
 * - The number of an interrupt cannot be changed.  (Note that the
 * parameter to a system call, normally kept in the eax register, can
 * be freely changed in a basic block: but not in a trace.)
 * - A system call or interrupt instruction can only be added
 * if it satisfies the above constraints: i.e., if it is the final
 * instruction in the block and the only system call or interrupt.
 * - All IT blocks must be legal.  For example, application instructions
 * inside an IT block cannot be removed or added to without also
 * updating the OP_it instruction itself.  Clients can use
 * the combination of dr_remove_it_instrs() and dr_insert_it_instrs()
 * to more easily manage IT blocks while maintaining the simplicity
 * of examining individual instructions in isolation.
 * - The block's application source code (as indicated by the
 * translation targets, set by #instr_set_translation()) must remain
 * within the original bounds of the block (the one exception to this
 * is that a jump can translate to its target).  Otherwise, DR's cache
 * consistency algorithms cannot guarantee to properly invalidate the
 * block if the source application code is modified.  To send control
 * to other application code regions, truncate the block and use a
 * direct jump to target the desired address, which will then
 * materialize in the subsequent block, rather than embedding the
 * desired instructions in this block.
 * - There is a limit on the size of a basic block in the code cache.
 * DR performs its own modifications, especially on memory writes for
 * cache consistency of self-modifying (or false sharing) code
 * regions.  If an assert fires in debug build indicating a limit was
 * reached, either truncate blocks or use the -max_bb_instrs runtime
 * option to ask DR to make them smaller.
 *
 * To support transparent fault handling, DR must translate a fault in the
 * code cache into a fault at the corresponding application address.  DR
 * must also be able to translate when a suspended thread is examined by
 * the application or by DR itself for internal synchronization purposes.
 * If the client is only adding observational instrumentation (i.e., meta
 * instructions: see #instr_set_meta()) (which should not fault) and
 * is not modifying, reordering, or removing application instructions,
 * these details can be ignored.  In that case the client should return
 * #DR_EMIT_DEFAULT and set up its basic block callback to be deterministic
 * and idempotent.  If the client is performing modifications, then in
 * order for DR to properly translate a code cache address the client must
 * use #instr_set_translation() in the basic block creation callback to set
 * the corresponding application address (the address that should be
 * presented to the application as the faulting address, or the address
 * that should be restarted after a suspend) for each modified instruction
 * and each added application instruction (see #instr_set_app()).
 *
 * There are two methods for using the translated addresses:
 *
 * -# Return #DR_EMIT_STORE_TRANSLATIONS from the basic block creation
 *    callback.  DR will then store the translation addresses and use
 *    the stored information on a fault.  The basic block callback for
 *    \p tag will not be called with \p translating set to true.  Note
 *    that unless #DR_EMIT_STORE_TRANSLATIONS is also returned for \p
 *    for_trace calls (or #DR_EMIT_STORE_TRANSLATIONS is returned in
 *    the trace callback), each constituent block comprising the trace
 *    will need to be re-created with both \p for_trace and \p
 *    translating set to true.  Storing translations uses additional
 *    memory that can be significant: up to 20% in some cases, as it
 *    prevents DR from using its simple data structures and forces it
 *    to fall back to its complex, corner-case design.  This is why DR
 *    does not store all translations by default.
 * -# Return #DR_EMIT_DEFAULT from the basic block creation callback.
 *    DR will then call the callback again during fault translation
 *    with \p translating set to true.  All modifications to \p bb
 *    that were performed on the creation callback must be repeated on
 *    the translating callback.  This option is only possible when
 *    basic block modifications are deterministic and idempotent, but
 *    it saves memory.  Naturally, global state changes triggered by
 *    block creation should be wrapped in checks for \p translating
 *    being false.  Even in this case, #instr_set_translation() should
 *    be called for application instructions even when \p translating is
 *    false, as DR may decide to store the translations at creation
 *    time for reasons of its own.
 *
 * Furthermore, if the client's modifications change any part of the
 * machine state besides the program counter, the client should use
 * #dr_register_restore_state_event() or
 * #dr_register_restore_state_ex_event() to restore the registers and
 * application memory to their original application values.
 *
 * For meta instructions that do not reference application memory
 * (i.e., they should not fault), leave the translation field as NULL.
 * A NULL value instructs DR to use the subsequent application
 * instruction's translation as the application address, and to fail
 * when translating the full state.  Since the full state will only be
 * needed when relocating a thread (as stated, there will not be a
 * fault here), failure indicates that this is not a valid relocation
 * point, and DR's thread synchronization scheme will use another
 * spot.  If the translation field is set to a non-NULL value, the
 * client should be willing to also restore the rest of the machine
 * state at that point (restore spilled registers, etc.) via
 * #dr_register_restore_state_event() or
 * #dr_register_restore_state_ex_event().  This is necessary for meta
 * instructions that reference application memory.  DR takes care of
 * such potentially-faulting instructions added by its own API
 * routines (#dr_insert_clean_call() arguments that reference
 * application data, #dr_insert_mbr_instrumentation()'s read of
 * application indirect branch data, etc.)
 *
 * \note In order to present a more straightforward code stream to clients,
 * this release of DR disables several internal optimizations.  As a result,
 * some applications may see a performance degradation.  Applications making
 * heavy use of system calls are the most likely to be affected.
 * Future releases may allow clients some control over performance versus
 * visibility.  The \ref op_speed "-opt_speed" option can regain some
 * of this performance at the cost of more complex basic blocks that
 * cross control transfers.
 *
 * \note If multiple clients are present, the instruction list for a
 * basic block passed to earlier-registered clients will contain the
 * instrumentation and modifications put in place by later-registered
 * clients.
 *
 * \note Basic blocks can be deleted due to hitting capacity limits or
 * cache consistency events (when the source application code of a
 * basic block is modified).  In that case, the client will see a new
 * basic block callback if the block is then executed again after
 * deletion.  The deletion event (#dr_register_delete_event()) will be
 * raised at deletion time.
 *
 * \note If the -thread_private runtime option is specified, clients
 * should expect to see duplicate tags for separate threads, albeit
 * with different dcrcontext values.  Additionally, DR employs a
 * cache-sizing algorithm for thread private operation that
 * proactively deletes fragments.  Even with thread-shared caches
 * enabled, however, certain situations cause DR to emit
 * thread-private basic blocks (e.g., self-modifying code).  In this
 * case, clients should be prepared to see duplicate tags without an
 * intermediate deletion.
 *
 * \note A client can change the control flow of the application by
 * changing the control transfer instruction at end of the basic block.
 * If a basic block is ended with a non-control transfer instruction,
 * an application jump instruction can be inserted.
 * If a basic block is ended with a conditional branch,
 * \p instrlist_set_fall_through_target can be used to change the
 * fall-through target.
 * If a basic block is ended with a call instruction,
 * \p instrlist_set_return_target can be used to change the return
 * target of the call.

 *   (called with \p for_trace set to true) as the trace is being built.

 *   removed.
 *
 * If hitting a size limit due to extensive instrumentation, reduce
 * the -max_trace_bbs option to start with a smaller trace.
 *
 * The basic block restrictions on modifying application source code
 * apply to traces as well.  If the user wishes to change which basic

 * All of the comments for #dr_register_bb_event() regarding

 *
 * When DR needs to translate a code cache context, DR recreates the

 * callbacks with the \p translating parameter set to true.  DR uses the

 * The \p app_code_consistent parameter indicates whether the original

 * guaranteed to still be in the same state it was when the code was
 * placed in the code cache.  This guarantee varies depending on the

 *
 * \note This version of DR does not intercept the signals SIGCONT,
 * SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, or SIGTTOU.  Future versions should add
 * support for these signals.

 *
 * The behavior of dr_sscanf() is mostly identical to that of the sscanf() C
 * routine.
 *
 * Supported format specifiers:
 * - \%s: Matches a sequence of non-whitespace characters.  The string is copied
 *   into the provided output buffer.  To avoid buffer overflow, the caller
 *   should use a width specifier.
 * - \%c: Matches any single character.
 * - \%d: Matches a signed decimal integer.
 * - \%u: Matches an unsigned decimal integer.
 * - \%x: Matches an unsigned hexadecimal integer, with or without a leading 0x.
 * - \%p: Matches a pointer-sized hexadecimal integer as %x does.
 * - \%%: Matches a literal % character.  Does not store output.
 *
 * Supported format modifiers:
 * - *: The * modifier causes the scan to match the specifier, but not store any
 *   output.  No output parameter is consumed for this specifier, and one should
 *   not be passed.
 * - 0-9: A decimal integer preceding the specifier gives the width to match.
 *   For strings, this indicates the maximum number of characters to copy.  For
 *   integers, this indicates the maximum number of digits to parse.
 * - h: Marks an integer specifier as short.
 * - l: Marks an integer specifier as long.

 * then restore the saved state.
 *
 * The callee must use the standard C calling convention that matches the
 * underlying 32-bit or 64-bit binary interface convention ("cdecl"). Other
 * calling conventions, such as "fastcall" and "stdcall", are not supported.
 *
 * This routine expects to be passed a number of arguments beyond \p
 * num_args equal to the value of \p num_args.  Each of those
 * arguments is a parameter to pass to the clean call, in the order
 * passed to this routine.  Each argument should be of type #opnd_t
 * and will be copied into the proper location for that argument
 * slot as specified by the calling convention.
 *
 * Stores the application state information on the DR stack, where it can
 * be accessed from \c callee using dr_get_mcontext() and modified using
 * dr_set_mcontext().
 *
 * On x86, if \p save_fpstate is true, preserves the fp/mmx state on the
 * DR stack. Note that it is relatively expensive to save this state (on the
 * order of 200 cycles) and that it typically takes 512 bytes to store
 * it (see proc_fpstate_save_size()).
 * The last floating-point instruction address in the saved state is left in
 * an untranslated state (i.e., it may point into the code cache).
 *
 * On ARM/AArch64, \p save_fpstate is ignored.
 *
 * DR does support translating a fault in an argument (e.g., an
 * argument that references application memory); such a fault will be
 * treated as an application exception.
 *
 * The clean call sequence will be optimized based on the runtime option
 * \ref op_cleancall "-opt_cleancall".
 *
 * For 64-bit, for purposes of reachability, this call is assumed to
 * be destined for encoding into DR's code cache-reachable memory region.
 * This includes the code cache as well as memory allocated with
 * dr_thread_alloc(), dr_global_alloc(), dr_nonheap_alloc(), or
 * dr_custom_alloc() with #DR_ALLOC_CACHE_REACHABLE.  The call used
 * here will be direct if it is reachable from those locations; if it
 * is not reachable, an indirect call through r11 will be used (with
 * r11's contents being clobbered).  Use dr_insert_clean_call_ex()
 * with #DR_CLEANCALL_INDIRECT to ensure reachability when encoding to
 * a location other than DR's regular code region.  See also
 * dr_insert_call_ex().
 *
 * \note The stack used to save state and call \p callee is limited to
 * 20KB by default; this can be changed with the -stack_size DR runtime
 * parameter.  This stack cannot be used to store state that persists
 * beyond \c callee's return point.
 *
 * \note This routine only supports passing arguments that are
 * integers or pointers of a size equal to the register size: i.e., no
 * floating-point, multimedia, or aggregate data types.
 * The routine also supports immediate integers that are smaller than
 * the register size, and for 64-bit mode registers or memory references that

 *
 * \note For 64-bit mode, passing arguments that use calling

 *
 * \note For 64-bit mode, if a 32-bit immediate integer is specified as an
 * argument and it has its top bit set, we assume it is intended to be
 * sign-extended to 64-bits; otherwise we zero-extend it.
 *
 * \note For 64-bit mode, variable-sized argument operands may not work
 * properly.

/**
 * \warning This patching interface is in flux and is subject to
 * change in the next release.  Consider it experimental in this
 * release.
 *
 * Registers a callback function for patching code prior to storing it in a
 * persisted cache file.  The length of each instruction cannot be changed, but
 * displacements and offsets can be adjusted to make the code
 * position-independent.  A patch callback is only called once per persisted
 * file, regardless of whether one or all of read-only, executable, or writable
 * data has been added.  Use the \p user_data parameter to pass the file offset
 * or other data from the other persistence events to this one.
 *
 * @param[in] func_patch  The function to call to perform any necessary
 *   patching of the to-be-persisted basic block code.  The function
 *   should decode up to \p bb_size bytes from \p bb_start and look for call or
 *   jump displacements or rip-relative data references that need to
 *   be updated to use data in the persisted file.  There is no padding
 *   between instructions, so a simple decode loop will find every instruction.
 *   The \p perscxt parameter can be passed to the routines
 *   dr_persist_start(), dr_persist_size(), and dr_fragment_persistable() to
 *   identify the region of code being persisted.
 * \return whether successful.
