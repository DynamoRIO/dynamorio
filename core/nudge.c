     *  doesn't free the stack.

     * have the nudge thread creator free the app stack (nudger free).  Going with
     * nudgee free means we leak exit race nudge stacks whereas if we go with nudger free
     * for external nudges then we'll leak timed out nudge stacks (for internal nudges
     * we pretty much have to do nudgee free).  A nudge_arg_t flag is used to specify
     * which model we use, but currently we always nudgee free.
