 * 128-bit packed doubles from 128-bit packed floats, e.g.  Would any client
 * want that distinction?  There are enough subtleties in the ISA that
 * dispatching by opcode is probably going to be necessary for the client anyway
 * (e.g., maskmovq only writes selected bytes).  Furthermore, many of the
 * distinctions in the OPSZ_ constants apply only to registers, with such
 * distinctions having no way to be specified when constructing an operand as we
 * do not use the size field for register operand types (we only use it for
 * immediates and memory references): to be complete in supplying formatting
 * information we would want to use that field.  Decision: we're only going to
