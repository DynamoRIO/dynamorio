# This file defines instruction encodings for the Scalable Vector Extension
# (SVE) and is a placeholder for future work. There are 1288 instructions in
# the specification including their variants. This file is for version 1 of
# SVE. Version 2 instructions will be defined in another codec_<version>.txt
# file when implemented.

# See header comments in codec_v80.txt and opnd_defs.txt to understand how
# instructions are defined for the purposes of decode and encode code
# generation.
