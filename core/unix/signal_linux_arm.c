/* There is a bug in all released kernels up to 4.12 when CONFIG_IWMMXT is
 * enabled but the hardware is not present or not used: the VFP frame in the
 * ucontext is offset as if there were a preceding IWMMXT frame, though this
 * memory is in fact not written to by the kernel. We work around this by
 * sending ourselves a signal at init time and looking for the VFP frame in
 * both places. We can then initialise vfp_offset and know where to look in
 * future.
 * XXX: Because of the IWMMXT space being unset by earlier kernels it is
 * possible that we might find the VFP frame header in both places. We could
 * guard against that by clearing some memory below the SP before sending the
 * signal (assuming sigaltstack has not been used).
 * XXX: When the kernel bug has been fixed we could implement a proper walk
 * through the frames but we will need to work with old kernels in any case.
