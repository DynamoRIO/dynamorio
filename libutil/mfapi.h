 * --------------------------------------
 *
 *
 * the syntax of the policy definition message is as follows:

 * <policy_message> ::==
 *  POLICY_VERSION=30000
 *  APPINITFLAGS=<string>
 *  APPINITWHITELIST=<string>
 *  APPINITBLACKLIST=<string>

 *  END_BLOCK
 *

 *
 * <dynamorio_option_line> ::== <dynamorio_option>=<string>
 *
 * <dynamorio_option> ::==
 *  [ DYNAMORIO_OPTIONS |
 *    DYNAMORIO_AUTOINJECT |
 *    DYNAMORIO_RUNUNDER |
 *    DYNAMORIO_HOT_PATCH_MODES |
 *    DYNAMORIO_HOT_PATCH_POLICIES ]
 *
 * <hot_patch_block> ::==
 *  BEGIN_MP_MODES
 *  <num_hot_patch_lines>
 *  <hot_patch_line>*
 *  END_MP_MODES
 *
 * <num_hot_patch_lines> ::== (int)
 *
 * <hot_patch_line> ::==
 *  <patch_id>:<patch_mode>
 *
 * <patch_mode> ::== [ 0 | 1 | 2 ]
 *
 * <patch_id>: provided by Determina
 *
 * <boolean> ::== [ 0 | 1 ]
 *
 *
 *
 * details:
 *
 * (1) the APPINITFLAGS, together with the APPINITBLACKLIST and
 * APPINITWHITELIST, controls how our bootstrap dll is added to the
 * AppInit_DLLs registry key. the value of the flags should be a sum
 * of the APPINIT_* flags as defined in share/config.h
 *
 * The APPINITBLACKLIST and APPINITWHITELIST values are only used if
 * specified by the flags. we'll provide the whitelist/blacklist.
 *
 *
 * (2) GLOBAL_PROTECT: OPTIONAL: if this is 0, then protection is
 * disabled (and all application blocks are optional). in normal
 * situations this will be 1. if this is not specified, then the
 * current setting is kept (see also enable_protection)
 *
 *
 * (3) there must be a GLOBAL block, which should come first, and it
 * must have DYNAMORIO_RUNUNDER=1 set as an option. for consistency it
 * should set DYNAMORIO_OPTIONS to blank (DYNAMORIO_OPTIONS=).
 *
 *
 * (4) the APP_NAME must be a valid "application id". this is usually
 * the .exe filename, but can also be "qualified". we will provide a
 * complete list of supported applications.
 *
 *
 * (5) some applications will also require special values for
 * DYNAMORIO_RUNUNDER; we will provide this information as well.
 *
 *
 * (6) DYNAMORIO_AUTOINJECT must be specified for every non-global
 * application block, and it should be of the format
 * "\lib\NNNNN\dynamorio.dll", where NNNNN is the version number of
 * the core dll being used. in general, any value that starts with a
 * "\" will have the local installation path prepended when using the
 * actual value (eg, it indicates a relative installation path).
 *
 *
 * (7) DYNAMORIO_OPTIONS is a string consisting of protection options
 * to our core. the variability in this will depend on the level of
 * configurability desired in your UI; but the majority of the options
 * will not need to change. probably the only configuration necessary
 * will be whether an app should be on or off; and this should be
 * controlled by including or excluding the corresponding app block.
 *
 *
 * (8) to enable hot patching, there are three additional
 *     requirements:
 *    (a) the global DYNAMORIO_HOT_PATCH_DEFS option should be
 *        declared, and point to the relative subpath of the hot patch
 *        definitions file (provided with the update package). Typically
 *        this should just be "\config" -- the engine version and
 *        file name is standard. Of course this file must exist in the
 *        proper place: "\config\30000\hotp-defs.cfg".
 *    (b) similary, each app must provide the DYNAMORIO_HOT_PATCH_MODES
 *        subpath for the hotp modes file. Typically this will be the
 *        config directory followed by the app name, e.g.,
 *        "\config\detertest.exe". The modes files are created by the
 *        import process and should NOT be created manually.
 *    (c) Each app that requires patches must specify a list of patch
 *        id's and their "modes".  The mode codes are 0 = Off, 1 =
 *        Detect Only, 2 = Protect.  Typically only modes 0 and 2 will
 *        be used. As indicated above, the first line must be the number
 *        of patches specified. The list of patch id's and their
 *        descriptions is provided by Determina in the patch update
 *        packages.
 *
 * See sample.mfp for an example policy string.
 *

 *
 * if warning is not NULL, it will be set to an error
 *   code indicating if a non-critical error (such as detach) was
 *   encountered.

 * APPINIT_BAIL_ON_LIST_VIOLATION

 *
 * APPINIT_SYS32_USE_LENGTH_WORKAROUND
 *   Not yet supported -- must be zero. Placeholder
 *     for using some alternate technique to handle

 *   If set, any other appinit entries are

 *    all entries are left intact, and an
