/**

 * @brief Tool front-end API.  Use these functions to search for and query
 * the properties of a target application file, check environment variables,
 * and perform other common actions in a tool front-end executable.
 * The library provides cross-platform utilities that support internationalization.
 *
 * The general usage model is for the front-end executable to always deal with
 * UTF-8 strings and let this front-end library perform conversion back and
 * forth to UTF-16 when interacting with Windows library.  The executable should
 * declare its main routine as follows:
 *
 *   int _tmain(int argc, TCHAR *targv[])
 *
 * And then invoke drfront_convert_args() to convert them to UTF-8.  All further
 * references to the arguments should use the UTF-8 versions.
 * On Linux or MacOS, _tmain and TCHAR will turn into regular symbols.
