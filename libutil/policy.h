 policy definition format specification
-----------------------------------------


the syntax of the policy definition message is as follows:

<policy_message> ::==
 POLICY_VERSION=<string>
 APPINITFLAGS=<string>
 APPINITWHITELIST=<string>
 APPINITBLACKLIST=<string>
 GLOBAL_PROTECT=<boolean>
 <application_block>*

<application_block> ::==
 BEGIN_BLOCK
 <app_specifier>
 <dynamorio_option_line>*
 END_BLOCK

<app_specifier> ::== [ GLOBAL | APP_NAME=<string> ]

<dynamorio_option_line> ::== <dynamorio_option>=<string>

<dynamorio_option> ::==
 [ DYNAMORIO_OPTIONS |
   DYNAMORIO_AUTOINJECT |
   DYNAMORIO_RUNUNDER ]

<boolean> ::== [ 0 | 1 ]



details:

(1) the APPINITFLAGS, together with the APPINITBLACKLIST and
    APPINITWHITELIST, controls how our bootstrap dll is added to the
    AppInit_DLLs registry key. the value of the flags should be a sum
    of the APPINIT_* flags as defined in share/config.h

    the APPINITBLACKLIST and APPINITWHITELIST values are only used if
    specified by the flags. we'll provide the whitelist/blacklist.


(2) GLOBAL_PROTECT: OPTIONAL: if this is 0, then protection is
    disabled (and all application blocks are optional). in normal
    situations this will be 1. if this is not specified, then the
    current setting is kept (see also enable_protection)


(3) there must be a GLOBAL block, which should come first, and it must
have DYNAMORIO_RUNUNDER=1 set as an option. for consistency it should
set DYNAMORIO_OPTIONS to blank (DYNAMORIO_OPTIONS=).


(4) the APP_NAME must be a valid "application id". this is usually the
.exe filename, but can also be "qualified". we will provide a complete
list of supported applications.


(5) some applications will also require special values for
DYNAMORIO_RUNUNDER; we will provide this information as well.


(6) DYNAMORIO_AUTOINJECT must be specified for every non-global
application block, and it should be of the format
"\lib\NNNNN\dynamorio.dll", where NNNNN is the version number of the
core dll being used. in general, any value that starts with a "\" will
have the local installation path prepended when using the actual
value (eg, it indicates a relative installation path).


(7) DYNAMORIO_OPTIONS is a string consisting of protection
options to our core. the variability in this will depend on the level
of configurability desired in your UI; but the majority of the options
will not need to change. probably the only configuration necessary
will be whether an app should be on or off; and this should be
controlled by including or excluding the corresponding app block.
