  # 64-bit Linux build with clang, no tests (runsuite.cmake disables the tests),
  # install and require clang-format.
  # We used to build 32-bit with clang but have decided that is not worth
  # the CI resources: 64-bit hits most clang-only warnings and 64-bit
  # is the primary target these days.
