    # failures, which are expected to be rare, it is fine.
    #
    # We keep this condition in this reusable workflow to avoid its
    # duplication across all callers. Callers should specify an
    # always() condition to ensure this reusable workflow is not
    # prematurely skipped (since, by default, a failing job skips all
    # jobs that need it). Note that the following condition still
    # ensures that a new runner or job is not launched when not needed.
