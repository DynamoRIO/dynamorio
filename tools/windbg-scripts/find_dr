* XXX: currently both are to be used as commands,
* e.g. finddr_slow or finddr_fast, preferrably should be arguments to .reload

* use for analyzing processes too early or too late for following drmarker with finddr_fast
as finddr_slow .foreach ( base {s -[1]a 0 L?80000000 ", build" } ) { !vprot base }

* follow drmarker from ntdll!KiUserCallbackDispatcher
