 * references. For far memory references via DS and ES, we assume that
 * the segment base is 0.
 *
 * All registers used in \p memref must hold their original
 * application values in order for the proper address to be computed
 * into \p dst.  The \p dst register may overlap with the registers
 * used in \p memref.  On ARM, \p scratch must be different from those used
 * in \p memref (as well as from \p dst).
 * On x86, \p scratch will not be used unless \p memref is a far reference
 * that either uses \p dst or is a base-disp with both a base and an index,
 * or \p memref is a reference in the #OP_xlat instruction.
 *
 * To obtain each memory address referenced in a single-instruction
 * string loop, use drutil_expand_rep_string() to transform such loops
 * into regular loops containing (non-loop) string instructions.

/**
 * Expands single-instruction string loops (those using the \p rep or

 * analysis.  This is accomplished by arranging for each
 * single-instruction string loop to occupy a basic block by itself
 * (by truncating the prior block before the loop, and truncating
 * instructions after the loop) and then exanding it into a
 * multi-instruction loop.
 *
 * WARNING: The added multi-instruction loop contains several
 * control-transfer instructions and is not straight-line code, which
 * can complicate subsequent analysis routines.
 *
 * WARNING: The added instructions have translations that are in the
 * middle of the original string loop instruction.  This is to prevent
 * passes that match exact addresses from having multiple hits and
 * doing something like inserting 6 clean calls.
 *
 * WARNING: The added instructions include a jecxz instruction which
 * will not be transformed into a 32-bit-reach instruction: thus,
 * excessive added instrumentation may result in a reachability problem.
 *
 * The client must use the \p drmgr Extension to order its
 * instrumentation in order to use this function.  This function must
 * be called from the application-to-application ("app2app") stage
 * (see drmgr_register_bb_app2app_event()).
 *
 * This transformation is deterministic, so the caller can return
 * DR_EMIT_DEFAULT from its event.
