/**
 * \warning This interface is in flux and is subject to change in the
 * next release.  Consider it experimental in this release.
 *
 * Replaces the application function that starts at the address \p
 * original with the natively-executed (i.e., as the client) code at
 * the address \p replacement.  The replacement should either be
 * the function entry point or a call site for the function, indicated
 * by the \p at_entry parameter.  For a call site, only that particular
 * call will be replaced, rather than every call to \p replacement.
 *
 * The replacement function must call drwrap_replace_native_fini()
 * prior to returning.  If it fails to do so, control will be lost and
 * subsequent application code will not be under DynamoRIO control.
 * The fini routine sets up a continuation function that is used
 * rather than a direct return.  This continuation strategy enables
 * the replacement function to use application locks (if they are
 * marked with dr_mark_safe_to_suspend()) safely, as there is no code
 * cache return point.
 *
 * The replacement function should use the same calling convention as
 * the original with respect to argument access.  In order to match
 * the calling convention return for conventions in which the callee
 * cleans up arguments on the stack, use the \p stack_adjust parameter
 * to request a return that adjusts the stack.  This return will be
 * executed as a regular basic block and thus a stack-tracking client
 * will not observe any missing stack adjustments.  The \p stack_adjust
 * parameter must be a multiple of sizeof(void*).
 *
 * If \p user_data != NULL, it is stored in a scratch slot for access
 * by \p replacement by calling dr_read_saved_reg() and passing
 * DRWRAP_REPLACE_NATIVE_DATA_SLOT.
 *
 * Only one replacement is supported per target address.  If a
 * replacement already exists for \p original, this function fails
 * unless \p override is true, in which case it replaces the prior
 * replacement.  To remove a replacement, pass NULL for \p replacement
 * and \b true for \p override.  When removing or replacing a prior
 * replacement, existing replaced code in the code cache will be
 * flushed lazily: i.e., there may be some execution in other threads
 * after this call is made.
 *
 * Non-native replacements take precedence over native.  I.e., if a
 * drwrap_replace() replacement exists for \p original, then a native
 * replacement request for \p original will never take effect.
 *
 * Only the first target replacement address in a basic block will be
 * honored.  All code after that address is removed.
 *
 * When replacing a function, it is up to the user to ensure that the
 * replacement mirrors the calling convention and other semantics of the
 * original function.
 *
 * The replacement code will be executed as client code, NOT as
 * application code.  However, it will use the application stack and
 * other machine state.  Usually it is good practice to call
 * dr_switch_to_app_state() inside the replacement code, and then
 * dr_switch_to_dr_state() before returning, in particular on Windows.
 * To additionally use a clean DR stack, consider using
 * dr_call_on_clean_stack() from the initial replacement layer (which
 * allows the outer layer to handle stdcall, which
 * dr_call_on_clean_stack does not support).
 *
 * The replacement code is not allowed to invoke dr_flush_region() or
 * dr_delete_fragment() as it has no #dr_mcontext_t with which to
 * invoke dr_redirect_execution(): it must return to the call-out point
 * in the code cache.  If the replacement code does not return to its
 * return address, DR will lose control of the application and not
 * continue executing it properly.
 *
 * @param[in] original  The address of either the application function entry
 *   point (in which case \p at_entry must be true) or of a call site (the
 *   actual call or tailcall/inter-library jump) (in which case \p at_entry
 *   must be false).
 * @param[in] replacement  The function entry to use instead.
 * @param[in] at_entry  Indicates whether \p original is the function entry
 *   point or a call site.
 * @param[in] stack_adjust  The stack adjustment performed at return for the
 *   calling convention used by \p original.
 *   On ARM, this must be zero.
 * @param[in] user_data  Data made available when \p replacement is
 *   executed.
 * @param[in] override  Whether to replace any existing replacement for \p
 *   original.
 *
 * \note The mechanism used for a native replacement results in a \p
 * ret instruction appearing in the code stream with an application
 * address that is different from an execution without a native
 * replacement.  The return address will be identical, however,
 * assuming \p original does not replace its own return address.
 *
 * \note The application stack address at which its return address is
 * stored is available by calling dr_read_saved_reg() and passing
 * DRWRAP_REPLACE_NATIVE_SP_SLOT.
 *
 * \note The priority of the app2app pass used here is

/**
 * Wraps the application function that starts at the address \p original
 * by calling \p pre_func_cb prior to every invocation of \p original
 * and calling \p post_func_cb after every invocation of \p original.
 * One of the callbacks can be NULL, but not both. Uses the default
 * calling convention for the platform (see DRWRAP_CALLCONV_DEFAULT
 * in #drwrap_callconv_t).
 *
 * Wrap requests should normally be made up front during process
 * initialization or module load (see
 * dr_register_module_load_event()).  If a wrap request is made after
 * the target code may have already been executed by the application,
 * the caller should flush the target code from the cache using the
 * desired flush method after issuing the wrap request.
 *
 * Multiple wrap requests are allowed for one \p original function
 * (unless #DRWRAP_NO_FRILLS is set).
 * Their callbacks are called sequentially in the reverse order of
 * registration.
 *
 * The \p pre_func_cb can examine (drwrap_get_arg()) and set
 * (drwrap_set_arg()) the arguments to \p original and can skip the
 * call to \p original (drwrap_skip_call()).  The \p post_func_cb can
 * examine (drwrap_get_retval()) and set (drwrap_set_retval()) \p
 * original's return value.  The opaque pointer \p wrapcxt passed to
 * each callback should be passed to these routines.
 *
 * When an abnormal stack unwind, such as longjmp or a Windows
 * exception, occurs, drwrap does its best to detect it.  All
 * post-calls that would be missed will still be invoked, but with \p
 * wrapcxt set to NULL.  Since there is no post-call environment, it
 * does not make sense to query the return value or arguments.  The
 * call is invoked to allow for cleanup of state allocated in \p
 * pre_func_cb.  However, detection of a stack unwind is not
 * guaranteed.  When wrapping a series of functions that do not
 * themselves contain exception handlers, pass the
 * DRWRAP_UNWIND_ON_EXCEPTION flag to drwrap_wrap_ex() to ensure that
 * all post-call callbacks will be called on an exception.
