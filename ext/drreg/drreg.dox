\page page_drreg Multi-Instrumentation Manager

The \p drreg DynamoRIO Register Management Extension is a mediator for
selecting, preserving, and using registers among multiple instrumentation
components.  The interface is meant to be used in concert with the \p drmgr
instrumentation pass scheme.  The results are most efficient when used in
the \p drmgr instrumentation insertion phase.  Use outside of the insertion
phase, such as during \p drmgr's instrumentation-to-instrumentation
transformation phase, or use outside of \p drmgr entirely, is supported,
but duplicate spills and restores may not be optimized away.

CAUTION: this extension is still a work in progress.  Not all pieces are
implemented yet, and the interface may be in flux until the details are
finalized.

\section sec_drreg_setup Setup

To use \p drreg with your client simply include this line in your client's
\p CMakeLists.txt file:

\code use_DynamoRIO_extension(clientname drreg) \endcode

That will automatically set up the include path and library dependence.

The initialization routine \p drreg_init() must be called prior to any of
the other routines.  Additional calls to drreg_init() are allowed (so long
as they are paired with corresponding calls to drreg_exit()) but only the
first caller's options are honored.  Typically this is the end-user tool
itself, with most other library components not directly interacting with
drreg (libraries often take in scratch registers from the caller for most
of their operations).

\section sec_drreg_usage Usage

The \p drreg API is based on a reservation model.  Each general-purpose
register may be reserved for a period of time and then unreserved.  The
process of reserving spills the application value, if necessary.  A
reservation implies exclusive access to that register.  Reservations may
extend across application instructions, in which case \p drreg will
automatically restore or re-spill application values, when the intervening
application instruction reads or writes that register, while still
preserving the client's value in that register for use after the
application instruction.  Reservations may not extend beyond the end of a
basic block.

\section sec_drreg_linear Linear Control Flow

The \p drreg API was designed for linear control flow.  The API assumes
that it can safely wait to restore an unreserved scratch register across
application instructions.  If a client inserts internal control flow inside
a basic block that crosses application instructions, and the client is not
explicitly ensuring that each forward jump contains the same set of saved
scratch registers at its source and target (typically done by saving all
scratch registers that will be needed inside control flow prior to any
forward branches), the client should tell \p drreg to disable its
optimizations.  This is done by calling drreg_set_bb_properties() and
passing #DRREG_CONTAINS_SPANNING_CONTROL_FLOW either prior to the drmgr
insertion phase or as early as possible in the insertion phase.  Setting
this property causes application instructions to become barriers to spilled
scratch registers that have been unreserved but have not yet been lazily
restored.  Such scratch registers are then restored prior to each
application instruction.  \p drreg will still collapse adjacent
spill+restore pairs for the same app instr.

For control flow added during the app2app phase (such as by
drutil_expand_rep_string()), \p drreg is able to identify and act on its
own.  Normally, drreg disables optimizations if it sees any kind of
internal control flow (viz., a branch with an instr_t target) while
examining code during the analysis phase.  If the client is certain that
all app2app internal control flow that it and any libraries it uses either
do not cross application instructions or satisfy the property that each
forward jump contains the same set of saved scratch registers at its source
as at its target (typically done by saving all scratch registers needed
inside control flow prior to any forward branches), then the client can
call drreg_set_bb_properties() and pass #DRREG_IGNORE_CONTROL_FLOW in order
to enable full lazy restores by \p drreg.
